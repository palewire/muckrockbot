If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 138 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 571 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,289 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,649 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nF: (540) 868-4391\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The FBI FOIA vault states \"The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 2023 I received an email stating that the Bureau sent me a response in May 2023 \u2013my assumption was that this was a long awaited production of records. I informed the Bureau I had received no such response and asked for it to be re-sent. \r\n\r\nToday I received an email of two linked PDF's; these are only acknowledgments dated from 2019 without any documents. I believe you can understand that after a four year wait, this is confusing and frustrating. \r\n\r\nI would like to have it clarified whether the Bureau, in May 2023, made a production, or if I just got a 2019 acknowledgment letter for no apparent reason? \r\n\r\nIf the documents are ready, then may I please get the actual documents and not just the acknowledgment letters? \r\n\r\nIf  this is not the case, then this correspondence should serve as notice of appeal of the Bureau's inappropriate and rude closure of the FOIPA case, with a request to remand the request with instructions not to properly search for records and produce them. \r\n\r\n-T.

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.

        "communication": "The FOIA \r\n\t\t\tappeal\r\n\t\t- EPA-2023-006330 has been supplemented with additional supporting files. Additional details for this item are as follows: \r\n \r\n  * Tracking Number: EPA-2023-006330 \r\n  * Requester: Grant Michael Hill \r\n  * Submitted Date:\t08/30/2023 \r\n  * Description: \r\n\t\t\t\t\tI'd like to appeal the determination on my FIOA request No. EPA-2023-005921. Please see the determination letter and responsive document attached. My request, filed via Muckrock, sought \"all records, documents, correspondence, materials, presentations, reports, and data concerning missing/unreported RadNet system data from stationary air monitors located in Boise, ID between November 15, 2018, and November 27, 2018.\"The responsive record provided is shockingly limited. It includes only the unpublished and unapproved data from EPA's RadNet monitoring system in Boise, ID, and excludes other materials I requested that must exist.According to the Department of Justice, an agency should interpret requests liberally and \"must be careful not to read [a] request so strictly that the requester is denied information the agency well knows exists in its files.\" Hemenway v. Hughes, 601 F. Supp. 1002, 1005 (D.D.C. 1985).Indeed, in his determination letter, Mr. Schoaff hints that more information concerning this unreported data truly exists, as he explains that the system did not report data from November 16 through November 21 \"because the monitor was not operating.\" How does Mr. Schoaff know this if not for the existence of additional records and information that was not provided? Nowhere in the responsive document does it state that the system was \"not operating.\" There's just missing data.Either Mr. Schoaff holds personal memories of this specific event from five years ago or (more likely) some record exists that indicated the system was inoperable and I was not provided it. The idea that the only record of the weeks-long inoperability of a crucial node in the agency's air monitoring system is a single page of data strains credulity. Did no one working with RadNet correspond with anyone else about the inoperable monitoring system and the unreported data? If not, how did anyone determine the system was inoperable in the first place? How did officials work together to bring the Boise system back online? The day after the RadNet monitor went offline, on November 17, 2018, there was an explosion at a US Ecology waste site in nearby Grandview, Idaho. The site manages radioactive materials. Was there zero correspondence between EPA officials concerning the unreported RadNet data, the nearest air monitor (which was inoperable), and this event? Did officials keep concerns about the potential for radiological exposure to themselves?It is hard to believe additional records and correspondence about the cause of this unreported data do not exist. Obviously, the cause of the unreported data \"concerns\" the unreported data itself. Thus, any records pertaining to the cause of the system going offline (the ultimate and proximate cause of the unreported data) clearly fall within the scope of my request and must be provided",

The City is subject to the Missouri Sunshine Law (Chapter 610 RSMo) and will be responding to this request under such provisions.\r\nIn addition, I have noted that you directed this request specifically to the Police Department and, therefore, I will only be responding with respect to records retained by the Police Department. If you intended this request to encompass all city records, please let me know immediately as it should be directed to the City Clerk.\r\nThe Police Department retains Sunshine Law requests in the same form as they are submitted to the department and are kept in paper format only. Under the Missouri Sunshine Law, local governments are not required to create new records. Therefore, we will provide you with copies of the sunshine law requests that were submitted to the Police Department during the relevant time period.\r\nDue to the scope of your request, it will take additional time to research the paper copies of the records, redact any information (such as social security numbers) that may be closed by law, and either copy or scan the records. I estimate that it will take approximately _2_ weeks.\r\nIn addition, given the work involved, a deposit of $25.00 will be required to begin the work. The research will not commence until your deposit is received. I will then work until the deposit is exhausted and provide an update on the status of the work. If the deposit exceeds the cost of the actual work, the difference will be refunded to you. If the actual work exceeds the amount of the deposit, you will be required to pay the additional costs of the work.\r\nAgain, I will not begin work until the deposit is received. I await the payment of the deposit.\r\n\nSean Madden\r\nRecords Clerk\r\nHazelwood PD\r\n314-513-5212\r\nsmmadden@hazelwoodmo.org\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D9DB4E.FC94C300]",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nSummary of oral decisions of Immigration Judge John P. Burns Dated 04/01/2021 \u2013 04/30/2023.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Summary of Oral Decisions\" refers to the official opinions issued by the immigration court in the form of concise summaries, intended for the convenience of the parties involved. These summaries aim to capture the essential points of oral decisions made during specific proceedings. It's important to note that these summaries are not meant to replace the original oral decisions but rather to serve as supplementary aids for better comprehension.\r\n\r\nRegarding the specific request for \"oral decision of immigration judge John Burns\" with the IJ code \"JHB,\" I understand that due to an ongoing backlog, locating Summaries of Decisions that have not yet been electronically filed could be challenging at this time. For this reason, I am requesting the production of all eROPs (electronically stored Summaries of Decisions) for the sake of efficiency. This request is made on behalf of the Deportation Accountability Project, a non-profit organization that aims to make deportation data publicly accessible. These records will be made available on our website, www.deportationaccountabilityproject.org.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that if one aspect of this request will take significantly longer than the other, please release the documents as they become accessible.\r\nWe would appreciate your assistance in randomly selecting 50 eROPs while ensuring the exclusion of any 'Summary of Oral Decisions' associated with Absentia Orders of Removal and 'MOTION TO TERMINATE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS.\r\nWe hold a specific interest in the respondent's country of origin, namely China, India, and Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv). Understanding how the BIA and the Immigration Courts operate, including whether they comply with the Immigration statute, the federal immigration regulations, and the binding precedents of federal courts is of grave national importance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nABIR APON",

EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",

For example, did you wish us to only search under \u201cCrime Free Housing Program\u201d and \u201cChronic Nuisance Properties,\u201d or are there other search terms you would like us to utilize?\u00a0 \u00a0Please clarify. \r\n\r\nOnce the above clarifications have been provided, we will proceed with a search for responsive records, if any, to your request.\u00a0 If further clarification is needed as we proceed (once the clarifications have been provided), we will let you know. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the above requested clarifications within 30 days of today\u2019s date, or by September 21, 2023.

Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Data and statistics on the extent of staffing shortages in hospitals and other healthcare facilities across the state, including but not limited to the number of vacant positions, the distribution of these vacancies by facility type and location, and the projected timeline for staffing shortages to continue.\r\n\r\n2. Any analyses or reports detailing the impacts of the severe understaffing on critical care provision and the ability to serve vulnerable populations, including estimated patient outcomes, increased wait times, and reduced accessibility to healthcare services.\r\n\r\n3. Records and documents relating to the immediate and critical need for supplemental staffing, including the specific measures taken to ensure that hospitals and healthcare facilities are adequately staffed during the disaster emergency.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the option analyses conducted to review non-emergency alternatives for addressing healthcare staffing issues, including but not limited to the evaluation of potential programs, initiatives, or other policy options that did not result in the declaration of a state of emergency.\r\n\r\n5. Records and documents related to the funding inadequacy for the non-emergency alternatives considered, detailing the reasons why these alternatives were deemed insufficient to address the staffing crisis and the decision-making process leading to the issuance of Executive Order No. 4.20.\r\n\r\n6. Information on other possible executive orders that were considered but not enacted in response to the healthcare staffing shortages, including their contents, reasons for dismissal, and any related cost-benefit analyses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Mr. Brandon Galbraith:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis email responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), dated September 11, 2023, attached. The FOIA and agency regulations require requesters to reasonably describe the record or records sought.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A); 49 CFR \u00a7 7.24(d). Your request, as described, seeks a significant amount of information and is too broad and complex in nature. Union Pacific is a very large Class 1 Railroad. Under the FOIA and agency regulations, the agency is not required to process requests that require an unreasonably burdensome search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRA asks that you reformulate or narrow the scope of your request to limit the burden on the agency. For example, focus on particular states, regions, cities, counties or inspector activities. When a request is properly contoured to provide such specificity, it enables the agency to locate records and process your request within a fair amount of time. As you consider your options to reformulate or narrow your request, please note that some records are publicly available. You may visit FRA's website to search for and locate documents that may assist you in better defining the scope of your request at https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/(e.g. railroad accident data or reports, including railroad supplied accident reports for specific accidents).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease respond within 14 calendar days of the date of this email. If we do not receive a response from you, we will administratively close the request without further processing.  If after we have closed your request, you decide that you are interested in the records, please submit another FOIA request to this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact the FOIA Office at FRAFOIA@dot.gov<mailto:FRAFOIA@dot.gov> if you have any questions or need assistance to reformulate or narrow your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOIA Team\r\n\r\nOffice of the Chief Counsel\nThanks,\r\n\r\nYolanda Brown\r\nDOT/FRA FOIA Analyst\r\nOffice of the Chief Counsel\r\nCell: (202) 961-1631\r\nyolanda.brown@dot.gov<mailto:yolanda.brown@dot.gov>",

I know as a general practice that DHS will close FOIA requests after forwarding the request to its sub agencies for processing. DO NOT DO THIS. If necessary, please SPLIT the request and assign them new tracking numbers. Again, DO NOT close my request for records in possession of DHS HQ and search for records in your posession. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made by Open The Government, a non-profit organization.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFreddy Martinez\n\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning or describing the creation or use of the Organized Crime\r\n    Information System (OCIS), including but not limited to manuals, guides and\r\n    briefings.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I do not consider your correspondence to represent a \"final response\" as detailed below, and therefore a lawful appeal is not appropriate until you have completed your response.\r\n\r\n1. This FOIA seeks documents from two agencies: The Federal Protective Services (FPS) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This response notes there are 178 responsive pages in FPS documents, but makes no mention of the documents requested from CBP. Please fullfill this FOIA in it's entirety by providing documents from both of the administrative units specified. If you are claiming that CBP does not have responsive records, please do so explicitly. Nonetheless, I do not consider this to be a \"final response\" until this question is resolved. \r\n\r\n2. This is a request for electronic copies of documents. If you believe that some portion of these documents should be redacted before release, please redact them in the customary manner: please \"black out\" the section of document that is redactable, and indicate by notation which subsection of FOIA exemption you believe applies *to each individual redaction*. \r\n\r\n3. The claim that all portions of all requested documents must be redacted is simply not credible. As the U.S. Department of Justice notes[1] \"The courts have held that the mere pendency of enforcement proceedings is an inadequate basis for the invocation of Exemption 7(A); the government must also establish that some distinct harm could reasonably be expected to result if the record or information requested were disclosed.\"  Distinct harm *must be indentified* for each individual redacted section. It is grossly inadequate to claim blanket immunity from public accountability and your assertion only serves to further damage DHS' credibility in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The phone numbers listed in your response are not monitored. Please do not use non-working phone numbers in future responses to me or other requestors. I consistently hear from FOIA officers that they have insufficient resources to fulfill the volume of FOIAs received, but simple steps--such as monitoring phone lines in order to fix defects such as those described above--would reduce the volume of correspondence and an agencies workload. \r\n\r\n[1] https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-guide-2004-edition-exemption-7a\r\n\r\n--\r\nJacob Fenton",

III(C)(5).\r\n\r\nFor fee purposes, please categorize me as a media requester. I am the founder and journalist for the MuckRock (MuckRock.com) website, which publishes original news content on a daily basis. All of MuckRock's content focuses either on FOIA itself or reports off of documents received via public records requests. Below are a number of the dozens of articles I have written for MuckRock:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/oct/21/there-bump-your-bill-heres-how-dea-tested-money-co/\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2011/dec/12/fbi-carrier-iq-files-used-law-enforcement-purposes/\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/nov/15/interview-john-young-founder-cryptome/\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/dec/12/open-government-open-source-licensing/\r\n\r\nIn addition to my capacity as founder and journalist of MuckRock, my work has been published in such online and print outlets as the Boston Globe, Commonwealth Magazine, and the New York Daily News. My coverage of topics from national cybersecurity to privacy to government waste has been cited by a host of other news outlets at the international, national and local levels.\r\n\r\nI plan to work closely with several intelligence and national security experts to analyze these documents and report on their contents.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Morisy\n\n",

Please include all policies and procedures related to how fees are set, accrued, imposed, collected, and enforced (such as those related to per diem fees, ability to pay determinations, penalties for late or non-payment, authorization for civil or criminal action for payment enforcement, etc). \r\n\r\n2) All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of individuals charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be processed by a representative of the news media/press and made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) The decisions issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals between October 1, 2016, and the date of processing of this request, arising from cases decided by former-IJ George W. Riggs, that were administratively closed, reversed, background check remand, and/or remand.\r\n\r\n2)  I would request any printouts, summaries, spreadsheets, reports, or other records or datasets that may encompass or address how many of removal orders included a negative credibility determination for any Respondent(s) for whom former-IJ George W. Riggs issued removal orders in protection/form I-589 cases (in other words, decisions on Asylum, Wittholding of Removal, or Relief under the Convention Against Torture), after merits/individual hearings occurred, between October 1, 2016 and the end of his tenure at EOIR.\r\n\r\n3) All correspondence or communications in any medium (including but not limited to any email, fax, letter, text/SMS/MMS, memorandum, voicemail, audio recording, sticky-note, or any attachment thereto, and any conversion of any of the foregoing from a digital to analog form/format, or vice-versa) to or from former-IJ George W. Riggs, from October 1, 2016 through the end of his tenure at EOIR, containing the words \"credibility,\" \"credible,\" \"incredible,\" \"incoherent,\" \"demeanor,\" \"candor,\" \"evasive,\" \"non-responsive,\" \"responsiveness,\" \"inconsistent,\" \"consistent,\" \"consistency,\" \"facial expression(s),\" \"body language,\" \"standard language,\" or \"addendum of law,\" or any abbreviation, contraction, misspelling, pluralization, or paraphrase thereof.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of each and every \"standard language addendum of law\" or any substantially similar 'boilerplate' or 'template' document utilized by former-IJ George W. Riggs as an exhibit in, as an attachment to, or as a drafting aid for any merits decision in a protection/form I-589 matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested records will be made available to the general public via a FOIA records clearinghouse, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes; rather, the results will be disseminated to interested individuals free of charge, and with no pecuniary gain to the Requestor, who is not (I hope and assume) the subject of any of these records.  Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business.  You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts.  Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.  It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. \r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDerrick Hensley",

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request.
