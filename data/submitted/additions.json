Each Call Sheet includes a list of Fire Department employees at the time of the call, member certifications, what members responded to the call, the response role of each member, the staffing of each apparatus that responded, and the total members that responded to the call. The back side of the call sheet may also include a brief handwritten 1-2 sentence description of the call and the actions taken by the Fire Department. Each Call Sheet has a corresponding Dispatch Times sheet provided by Derry Fire Alarm showing the details of the call (address, determinant level for EMS calls, units responding, and the times of each unit responding). It is believed that these records are located at the Chester Fire Department and are believed to be contained within 3-ring binders with each Dispatch Times Sheet stored together with the corresponding Call Sheet.\r\n\r\nThis request does NOT include official incident reports created by the Chester Fire Department and submitted to NFIRS.  \r\n\r\nPARTICIPATION REPORTS\r\nChester Fire Department participation reports from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2023 (including the quarterly report JAN-2023 through MAR-2023). These reports are kept in Office Manager Ingalls office on the wall immediately to the left of the door. These reports list the call, training, and combined participation percentages of every member on a monthly and quarterly basis. These reports show the participation of employees acting in their official capacities as municipal employees and provide insight into the efficiency/effectiveness of the Department and inform the public of the staffing level regularly available for emergency calls.\r\n\r\nTRUCK CHECK SHEETS\r\nTruck Check sheets for all apparatus (Rescue 1, Engine 1, Engine 2, Tank 1, Utility 1, Forestry 1, Forestry 2, and Car 1) from January 1, 2023 through April 1, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. The purpose of this request is to obtain the data necessary to generate statistics in aggregate concerning the staffing/certification level over a period of time and the availability of resources for emergencies. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin J Dolan",
