Your request mentioned: \u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \n\nPursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \n\nI am requesting a list of currently employed mental health professionals within your state's Department of Corrections or its subsidiary agencies, as well as their contact information. \n\nSpecifically, I am requesting: \n\n- Full names \n- Job titles \n- Assigned correctional facility \n- Government-issued email addresses \n- Government-issued phone numbers (direct desk numbers if available, otherwise department phone numbers with or without extensions) \n- Department/division (e.g. Behavioral Health, Mental Health Services) \n\nThis request applies to the following roles: rehabilitative program coordinators, licensed psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, and other licensed mental health professionals serving incarcerated populations in state-operated facilities. \n\nIf available, I request this information be provided in a machine-readable format such as CSV or Excel. \n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAndrew Ma \n\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdepartment-corrections-3973%252Frequest-for-correctional-mental-health-staff-directory-and-contact-information-department-of-corrections-186615%252F%253Femail%253Dopen.records%252540gdc.ga.gov&url_auth_token=AAANHax4879lPQcY-GyswBxh6Uc%3A1uFkmq%3AooyQPtk_T2tKm5zwBc23lHX1Uat4efnm_4bdCH7Km-0\u201d \nThis request appears to be for staff at each facility. The GDC contracts with an outside entity to provide medical services for inmates in facilities and those individuals are not employees of the GDC, and GDC does not have responsive documents. \nPlease feel free to contact me via the GDC's open records portal or by phone at (478) 550-6350, if you need any further assistance. \nSincerely, \nTimothy Duff \nAssistant General Counsel \nLegal Services \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Open Records Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXepXMZ14ulCf9LQprjaGBmx9dr04uiv4hl1U2hgxKSWRj5xVHRRGlao-2FfiA2YzG1k1z7pFOpl-2F0u46DvIFSS7RctNSfdzq1Og3IB4er38VnbxpEF_IkqGf3OYDNpKuC66-2F9jJjeAuWeBY8UKTOySNIkfJzLRFDMgOGvk9ongkjRrPY8A8j0BojabAo-2BZweltktfid-2FVT2TE1Rb2AUUO-2FaDDzx4l-2BFowM9LK1DtUComKMNEgcwKTto9XHSZiZ5-2BI6utmrXv8TfQuz9EQTUi-2Fzm569AYgPx2JHbE5JgdEaC6hlUvuq6lMvLfuBWxiq6I7Z2f2DD7Tj0wg4EtCwcWAzAv0JwKorDx-2Ff9ut-2FCXK6Kr-2FHZ5juWCXcXJBv2scQdBZVsou3RdL-2Fi-2Br0ipy5pY8Nl-2F7odX4QH6zfHCts1-2BC4qFj7xUsvg5Edmtg9idZf3G29ADac4TVmpCNJEVoqUPpk4CBRyJHY-2FIntxakwmXvKzyfRjBbgg)\n",
