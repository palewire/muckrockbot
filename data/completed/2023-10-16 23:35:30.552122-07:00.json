        "communication": "Dear Mr. Saulnier:\r\n\r\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) acknowledges receipt of your March 6, 2023 Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) request regarding Solicitation No. 0000008611 for the Bus Priority Violation Detection System.  Specifically, you requested the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Evaluation scores/notes related to ALL proposers\r\n  2.  Submitted responses of ALL proposers (with the exception of Verra Mobility)\r\n  3.  Debrief documents related to ALL proposers\r\n\r\nYour request is being processed pursuant to WMATA's Public Access to Records Policy (PARP).[1]\r\n\r\nPartial Decision\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.3 (exempt by statute - F.A.R. Section 24.202 - a proposal shall not be made available under the Freedom of Information Act unless it is incorporated into a contract) and PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information), we deny all portions of your request that pertain to companies other than the successful offeror.  There is a difference between a successful and unsuccessful offer for a government contract in terms of expectation of confidentiality, and there is a stronger public interest in the disclosure of awarded contract information than unsuccessful proposals. See Raytheon Co. v. Dep't of Navy, No. CIV. A. 89-2481, 1989 WL 550581, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 22, 1989) (quoting Racal-Milgo Government Systems, Inc. v. Small Business Admin., 559 F. Supp. 4, 6 (D.D.C. 1981)).  Unsuccessful proposals are not incorporated in a final awarded contract, and thus, those records are withheld.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege), bid evaluation documents are exempt from disclosure because they contain WMATA staff evaluations and recommendations regarding the proposals.  See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. General Services Admin., No. 89-0746, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3623 (D.D.C. 1992).\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not yet able to provide any responsive records, we can impart the following general information regarding your request:\r\n\r\nTime Period for Processing Requests\r\n\r\nWMATA generally aims to respond to a request for records within 20 business days following receipt of the request.  WMATA processes requests in the order that requests are received.  Furthermore, additional processing time is required for requests that prove to be complex.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that your request includes records submitted to WMATA by a third party, which requires us to contact the third party to identify confidential and proprietary information. WMATA will not release any records until it has had the opportunity to consult with the third party and received appropriate feedback.\r\n\r\nExemptions\r\n\r\nThe PARP provides exemptions for certain types of data, including: (1) information that could compromise WMATA infrastructure or security; (2) information that is solely related to the internal personnel rules and practices; (3) information that is exempt by statute; (4) proprietary commercial or financial information; (5) intra-agency and inter-agency memoranda information which would not be made available by law to a party in litigation with WMATA; (6) information that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (7) certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes; (8) registered SmarTrip\u00ae information; and (9) customer financial information.  Generally, WMATA's response will not include any exempt information.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nThe PARP also provides for the assessment of fees associated with a request that requires more than two hours of staff time to process.  These fees are calculated at the employees' basic rate of pay, plus an additional 50 percent to cover benefits. In general, a request is considered an agreement to pay all applicable fees.  Advance payment is required where the fees are likely to exceed $250. We will provide you an estimation of fees prior to the processing of any possible responsive records.\r\n\r\nAppeal Rights\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal WMATA's decision, in accordance with PARP \u00a7 9.1, you may file a written appeal of the action with the Executive Vice President, External Relations (or designee) at PARP_Appeal@wmata.com<mailto:PARP_Appeal@wmata.com>, within 30 business days of the date of this decision letter.  Further details about our appeals process can be found on our website.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Saulnier:\r\n\r\nThis is the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) final decision in response to your March 6, 2023, Public Access to Records Policy (PARP) request regarding Solicitation No. 0000008611 for the Bus Priority Violation Detection System.  Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  \"Evaluation scores/notes related to ALL proposers\r\n  2.  Submitted responses of ALL proposers (with the exception of Verra Mobility)\r\n  3.  Debrief documents related to ALL proposers\"\r\n\r\nYour request was processed pursuant to WMATA's PARP.[1]\r\n\r\nPrevious Partial Decision\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 2023, WMATA denied all portions of your request that pertain to companies other than the successful offeror pursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.3 (exempt by statute - F.A.R. Section 24.202 - a proposal shall not be made available under the Freedom of Information Act unless it is incorporated into a contract) and PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information).  WMATA also denied Part 1 of your request pursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege).\r\n\r\nDecision\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the following records responsive to the remainder of your request (133 pages total):\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  COBTR222155 Hayden AI Successful Proposal (133 pages).\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.4 (confidential commercial information), we have redacted business proprietary information that our contractor customarily and actually treats as confidential.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.5 (deliberative process privilege & self-evaluative privilege), we have redacted observations, evaluations, and determinations that were issued to help WMATA make a final decision.\r\n\r\nPursuant to PARP Exemption 6.1.6 (personal privacy), we have redacted personal information of individuals whose privacy interests outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nAfter a search reasonably calculated to find all relevant records, WMATA has found no additional records responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nWMATA spent more than 2 hours of staff time processing the records responsive to your request, which would normally result in processing fees which you would be responsible for.  However, the processing time was divided among the number of requesters seeking similar records, and as a result, the assessed processing time for this request is less than two hours.  Accordingly, pursuant to PARP \u00a7 8.5, the processing fees are waived.\r\n\r\nAppeal Rights\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal WMATA's decision, in accordance with PARP \u00a7 9.1, you may file a written appeal of the action with the Executive Vice President, External Relations (or designee) at PARP_Appeal@wmata.com<mailto:PARP_Appeal@wmata.com>, within 30 business days of the date of this decision letter.  Further details about our appeals process can be found on our website.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence. If you have any questions, please contact me, if I am unavailable, you may contact Richard Noh at RDNoh@wmata.com<mailto:RDNoh@wmata.com> or 202-962-2569.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Yanos\r\n\r\n[1] The PARP can be found on WMATA's website at https://www.wmata.com/about/records/public-records.cfm, under the section marked \"Legal Affairs.\"\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA003F.2D5DC2B0]\r\n\r\nBrian J.

Now that you've registered with Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging, communicating securely is easy!\r\n\r\nAs you know, Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging protects our confidential correspondences by using the same security technologies as internet banking when sending and receiving sensitive email messages. But you likely didn't know that this service allows you to do so much more than address security and compliance, or guarantee delivery of messages that prevent statements such as \"I never received it\".\r\n\r\nVillage of Fox Lake Secure Messaging includes a patented Delivery Slip - a powerful tool for users that provides many features for increased efficiencies and control over sensitive messages and attachments. It is found on the right side of  all secure message, both in this Secure Message Center and your desktop Microsoft Outlook program ('Enable with MS Office Outlook').\r\n\r\n5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip\r\n\r\nHere's just 5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip that you probably never thought possible with basic email:\r\n\r\n1. Know what happens to your secure message once it's sent. Track and prove when a secure message and attachment is received, read, replied to, forwarded, deleted or printed.\r\n\r\n2. Send jumbo files via email. Now you can simply attach that 100 MB file to a message without having to find an external service to share it.\r\n\r\n3. Completely recall a secure message - and it works! Now you can instantly retract a secure message and attachment - even days or weeks after the recipient has read the message - resulting in the recipient's inability to access or read the recalled secure message.\r\n\r\n4.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTitle and Copy List of the district's library catalog including all titles, authors, ISBN and copy information (example copies/location). \r\n\r\nNote: This information can generally be easily retrieved by a district level user of Follett using the Generate a Title & Copy List Report (Library Manager) feature of the Follett catalogue. Instructions are attached and  located here https://legacyhelp.fsc.follett.com/content/t_generate_title_copy_list_report.htm. Please include all titles (regardless of status) and include the categories and circulation statistics. \r\n\r\nPlease output the file(s) as Excel.\r\n\r\nIn the event the report is limited by the 10,000 title limit, please split it the catalogue information into multiple groupings as the report allows. For instance you could limit the titles in each file by selecting groupings A-G and H-Z.\r\n\r\nAs censorship is at an all time high, we are conducting research on titles that may be most at risk of censorship across Texas. We hope to assist schools in their mission of maintaining young learners critical access to books in their libraries.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSidney Braveword",

Mdtazwar Hasan as a subject. For specificity and to rule out duplicates, Mdtazwar Hasan was arrested on July 23, 2022 in the confines of the 107 Precinct in the County of Queens, New York.\r\n\r\nDivisions that may hold responsive records include Internal Affairs, Employment Management, and Department Advocate's Office; however, any record used to evaluate performance toward the subject's continued employment or promotion should be considered responsive.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Law as amended by Chapter 96 of the Laws of New York of 2020, records that may be released include \"the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee; the name of the employee complained of or charged; the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing; the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding; and the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the agency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered employee.\"\r\n\r\nUnder precedent, Freedom of Information Law uses a \"balancing test\" method of weighing privacy interests favoring redaction/denial against the public interest in favor of disclosure. This matter is of clear public interest for the following reasons: P.O. Mdtazwar Hasan has been publicly accused of engaging in an off-duty act of domestic violence in the County of Queens: https://bronx.com/nypd-police-officer-mdtazwar-hasan-24-arrested-2/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

News reports say University and city police responded to the campus at about 11:15 p.m on April 10th after police received three calls stating a shooter was in the Hillman Library on Forbes Avenue. In one call, the sound of gunshots was heard in the background, Pitt Police Chief Jim Loftus told reporters. \r\n\r\nI am looking for the audio of these calls as well as any after action reports, incident reports, investigative reports, call detail logs and body camera footage of officers responding to this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

Please also redact the identities of the prior owners of forfeited property.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned Public Records Request Number 23-18.\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of gathering, identifying, and reviewing responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that we have the records for calendar years 2015 through 2022 available in electronic format. The records for calendar years 2013 and 2014 currently exist only in paper form.\r\n\r\nThere will be a fee for converting the 2013-2014 records to an electronic format. The total cost will be based on the number of records to be scanned. We estimate that the charge for those records will be $120, although the final charge will be based on the actual number of records that are scanned.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm whether you want us to proceed with the production for the years 2013 and 2014.\u00a0We will provide the total cost before we begin scanning and collect payment at that time.\r\n\r\nWe estimate that there will be approximately 4,800 pages of responsive records for 2015-2022, and approximately 1,200 pages for 2013-2014. You requested that we redact the names of prior owners which adds to the processing time. Accordingly, we will provide the records in installments. We estimate the first installment will be available on or before May 21, 2023. We will continue to provide installments every 30 days with an estimated completion date of August 18, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please contact me directly through this Public Records Request portal, or by calling (360) 902-8907.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJilene Siegel\r\n\r\nOST Public Records Officer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Washington State Treasurer.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

While reviewing and preparing records for the first installment, I learned that some, but not all, of the 2015 paper reports have been scanned. (Converting the records from paper to electronic format is currently a work-in-progress that began earlier this year. After some of the 2015 reports were scanned, it was noted that 2015 was beyond the retention period. The decision was made at that time to discontinue scanning the records for calendar year 2015 and earlier.)\r\n\r\nBased on your request to limit our response to records that exist in electronic format, we will provide the 2015 records that were previously scanned, but we won\u2019t scan additional 2015 paper records.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, please let me know if you prefer that we exclude all 2015 reports, but it may impact how quickly we are able to provide our full response. Because the conversion is a work in progress, many of the files clearly identify the reporting period in the filename, so we could easily exclude those 2015 reports. Many other files currently include multiple reporting periods, so we would need to review each page in those files to remove the 2015 reports.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to call me if you\u2019d like to discuss these options further.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJilene Siegel\r\n\r\nOST Public Records Officer\r\n\r\n(360) 902-8907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Washington State Treasurer.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\n1. Any lease agreement for the office described in multiple recent news reports in Los Angeles, where the USCIS's efforts to denaturalize US citizens will be focused. A Miami Herald article dated July 9, 2019 states that USCIS has opened \"an office in Los Angeles specifically to work on these [denaturalization] cases\" and that \"Staffers have been working at the new office since January 2017, which the agency says will be the central office for reviewing potential denaturalization cases.\" https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article214173489.html. The same article states that \"Ten lawyers have already been hired for that office, according to officials at the Justice Department.\" \r\n\r\n2. The record referenced in the Miami Herald article linked above that describe the \"algorithm\" used to select the \"700,000 files\" the agency is now reviewing for denaturalization. \r\n\r\n3. In addition to the records requested above, I also request records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request. If you use FOIA questionnaires or certifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether they possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, I also request any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention on the administration\u2019s new denaturalization task force and efforts to denaturalize US citizens. See Scanning immigrants\u2019 old fingerprints, U.S. threatens to strip thousands of citizenship (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.171a50a5bf43); Trump Creates \u2018Denaturalization\u2019 Task Force to Pursue Deportation Against Thousands of U.S. Citizens (https://www.theroot.com/trump-creates-denaturalization-task-force-to-pursue-d-1827372139); Surely the Trump Administration Will Follow All the Rules When Stripping People of Citizenship (https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22061884/denaturalization-task-force-trump-citizenship/); Trump Administration Launches Effort to Strip Citizenship From Those Suspected of Naturalization Irregularities (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-administration-launches-denaturalization-effort-to-strip-citizenship-from-those-suspected-of-irregularities.html); APNewsBreak: US launches bid to find citizenship cheaters (https://apnews.com/1da389a535684a5f9d0da74081c242f3). This request goes directly to this action by the federal government.\r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about denaturalization.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles listed above describe a new task force seeking to strip citizenship from naturalized citizen based on a secret memo not yet released to the public and under a rubric that is unclear. While Cissna has said in multiple interviews he anticipates the filing of \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases, the FY2019 ICE budget states that only 855 of the fingerprint cards from Operation Janus and Operation Second Look are being considered for prosecution. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47. The original 2016 OIG report that started this process said there were 858 such cases. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2016/OIG-16-130-Sep16.pdf. Either way, the prospect that the new task force will file \"thousands\" of denaturalization cases raises serious concerns that Cissna's claims about the intentions and basis for denaturalization are being actively misstated in his interviews withe media. The FY2019 ICE budget also says the agency is looking to review 700,000 additional alien files for denaturalization, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf#page=47, while there were only 315,000 non-digitized fingerprint cards. Again, the numbers do not add up, and the notion that USCIS is planning \"thousands\" of denaturalizations while claiming all such cases arise from the mis-matched fingerprint cards is especially problematic.\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Hoppock\n\n",

We assigned your request tracking number ATFY22-145.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence concerning your request.\r\n\r\n           To the extent that your request requires a search in another Office, consultations with other Department of Justice components or another agency, and/or involves a voluminous amount of material, your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Accordingly, we will need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\r\n\r\nWe assign and process requests on a multitrack basis.  The time needed to complete our work on your request will depend on several factors, including the complexity of our records search, the volume and complexity of any material located, and the order of receipt of your request.  At this time, we have assigned your request to the complex track.  In an effort to speed up our process, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records. You can also agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located.  Any decision with regard to fees will be made after we determine whether fees will apply to this request.\r\n\r\nWe regret the necessity of this delay, but we assure you that your request will be processed as soon as possible. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact this Office by telephone at the above number, or you may write to the above address.  You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Wayne Foster, at the above telephone number or address to discuss any aspect of your request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (\"OGIS\") at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n                                                                                   Sincerely,\r\n\nFOIA/Privacy Act Unit\r\nAntitrust Division",

The Department of Banking is transitioning to a new online FOI management system called GovQA, accessible on the Department webpage:  https://FOI-Freedom-of-Information-Requests.

The Department is seeking to upload your request into the GovQA platform.  I am in communication with the Division responsible for managing the \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d records to which you refer, and I expect to issue a final response by September 29th at the latest, hopefully by September 21st.

Please note that the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission interprets \u2018promptly\u2019 under CGS Section 1\u201119(a), as \u201c \u2026 quickly and without undue delay, [considering] all of the factors presented by a particular request.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

In order to ensure an adequate response, your request requires clarification. We have identified an MS Excel list of 3,267 flight events which includes the following data elements: - Flight Date/Time - Flight Title (i.e. case number, if included) - Flight Description (i.e. case related or training*, etc., if included) - Takeoff Lat/Long (i.e. location) - Air Time - Air Seconds *note: most training events are blank This list includes Lat/Long so requires review of each event where there is a case number (investigation) to determine case status prior to release of the list. Open and active investigations are categorically exempt so we would not provide lat/long information. Based on current request volume and the time to review and determine each case status, we would anticipate completion of our review by April 10, 2023. If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know, and if we're able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly\u00a0do so. If, however, you're willing for us to remove the \"Takeoff Lat/Long\" column, we can provide a response much sooner. If we don't hear from you by , we will proceed with review of each individual investigation and you can expect a response by November 9, 2023 April 10, 2023. Your request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120. Please visit our and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. website PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. RCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. WAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified,a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. \r\nPlease reply directly to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.
