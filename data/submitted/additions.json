Victoria Avenue\r\nVentura, CA 93009\r\nEmail: info.vcsd@ventura.org\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nSubject: CPRA Request \u2013 Assault Incident Involving Joshua Block and Santos (April 23, 2025)\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nDear Custodian of Records,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act (CPRA), Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250\u20136276.48, and California Constitution Article I, \u00a7 3(b), I respectfully request access to public records related to an assault (non-domestic) incident involving Joshua Block and an individual identified as Santos, which occurred in Ventura County on or about April 23, 2025, at approximately 7:00 PM (19:00 hours).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nRecords Requested:\r\n\t1.\tBody-Worn Camera Footage\r\n\t\u2022\tAll body-worn camera (BWC) recordings from deputies who responded to the incident.\r\n\t2.\t911 Call Audio and Transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tAll emergency call recordings and transcripts related to this incident.\r\n\t3.\tCAD / Dispatch Logs\r\n\t\u2022\tFull dispatch data including unit assignments, timestamps, and call notes.\r\n\t4.\tIncident and Arrest Reports\r\n\t\u2022\tAll reports created in connection with this assault, including officer narratives, witness statements, investigative reports, and any arrest documentation.\r\n\t5.\tPhotographs or Supplemental Evidence\r\n\t\u2022\tAny digital evidence, such as photographs or surveillance obtained during the response.\r\n\t6.\tPreservation Notice\r\n\t\u2022\tI formally request that all potentially responsive records be preserved, including digital and metadata. Alteration or deletion of such records after receipt of this request may constitute a violation of Gov. Code \u00a7 6200 and legal precedent such as People v. Superior Court (Barrett), 80 Cal.App.4th 1305 (2000).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nLegal Justification:\r\n\t\u2022\tGov. Code \u00a7 6254(f) provides for public access to law enforcement response records including arrest information, time, location, and substance of calls.\r\n\t\u2022\tAB 748 (Gov. Code \u00a7 6254(f)(4)) mandates the disclosure of body-worn camera footage in incidents involving the use of force or where the public interest in disclosure clearly outweighs any investigatory need for withholding.\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts in CBS v. Block, 42 Cal.3d 646 (1986) and Haynie v. Superior Court, 26 Cal.4th 1061 (2001) require narrowly tailored justifications for any denial or redaction of law enforcement records.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe public\u2019s right to information that fosters accountability is further supported by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and People v. Superior Court (Johnson), 61 Cal.4th 696 (2015).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nFormat & Fee Waiver Request:\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in electronic format (PDF, MP4, etc.). I also request a waiver of fees under Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(e), as this request is made for public interest purposes and not commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf any fees are expected, I request a written estimate before incurring any charges.\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide an estimated date for completion in accordance with Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(c). I am available to assist in clarifying or narrowing this request if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter",
