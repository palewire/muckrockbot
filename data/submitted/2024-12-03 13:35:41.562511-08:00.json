Please include any records that originated from predecessor agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, etc.).  If any portion of this request is denied, I request a detailed explanation of the exemption(s) applied and a Vaughn Index describing withheld records and justifications for non-disclosure.\r\n\r\nFile Categories to Search:\r\nPlease search any relevant investigative, intelligence, or archival files pertaining to:\r\n1.

The information sought is of public and scholarly interest and pertains to understanding transnational organized crime during the post-war era.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nI am not requesting personal information or records that identify confidential informants, third parties, or victims. My request pertains solely to records documenting the activities of the Guerini family or broader patterns associated with their influence.\r\nIf any records contain sensitive material, I request that redacted versions be provided in accordance with FOIA requirements.  Please include any records that originated from predecessor agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, etc.).  If any portion of this request is denied, I request a detailed explanation of the exemption(s) applied and a Vaughn Index describing withheld records and justifications for non-disclosure.\r\n\r\nFile Categories to Search:\r\nPlease search any relevant investigative, intelligence, or archival files pertaining to:\r\n1. Narcotics trafficking (e.g., heroin smuggling routes from France to the U.S.).\r\n2. Labor movements and union activity (e.g., dock strikes influenced by organized crime).\r\n3. Political violence or unrest in post-war France tied to organized crime.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me here if clarification or additional information is required to process this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdward Nestor",
