Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \r\n\r\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25068. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

        "communication": "5/19/2025 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuck Rock News, DEPT MR182995 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25068 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025.  You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \n\nEnclosure(s):\t8 Pages\n",

Please provide these in the format in which they are stored in your system, which may be a database, spreadsheet, CSV file, or similar.

A data dictionary describing the properties present in the table, and how they relate to other records such as published incidents or arrests.\r\n3. Any additional training materials or documentation for how this data is created, or how it should be used internally.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the request cannot be met, please proceed with the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the request is denied, please cite the law under which the denial is allowed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This is not a usable database format, and would require significant effort to parse and use\u2014as not to mention the reality of error in conversion. I had originally requested that the records be shared in the same format in which you have them stored, i.e. a database.  Would your office be able to export this data into a more usable format? CSV, JSON, Excel, SQLite? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's not possible to determine whether each call was a police, fire, or EMS response. The data dictionary from WPRDC for the Fire/EMS dispatch is similar, but not applicable. Is there an explanation of the \"call type\" property which may shed some light, or a property which documents who was dispatched?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh",

We provide this memo whenrequired to defense counsel on cases involving this deputy. Becausethere is only one local deputy for whom we maintain PID information,there is no list. Just the single memo, which we are happy to provide. [ Potential Impeachment Disclosure memo attached here .] TheWashington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-widepotential impeachment issues with WSP employees. We do not maintain thisinformation in any organized way because it does not apply to anyofficers that regularly appear in our courts/cases. I just want toconfirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extentthat these records are related to WSP employees, are likely bettersought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (inaddition to any lists).\" I have been advised by the Sheriff's Office that there are no records responsive to the second portion of your request seeking\u00a0records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internaldepartment policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers. SkamaniaCounty has searched for, attempted to identify, locate, and provide anynon-exempt public records that may be responsive to this request. Since this completely fulfills your request, we are now closing this public records request. The one (1) yearstatute of limitations to seek judicial review under the Public RecordsAct (Chapter 42.56 RCW) begins now because Skamania County does notintend to further address this request. Please note that if you do not review and download your records within thirty (30) days, they may be removed from the system, in which case you will have to start the public records process all over again to receive your requested records. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns by replying to this email or at my phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson \r\nDeputy Public Records Officer \r\nOffice of the Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney \r\n240 NW Vancouver Avenue | PO Box 790 \r\nStevenson, WA 98648 \r\n509-427-3791",

I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term.\r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025.\r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask. \r\n\r\nI request: \r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term. \r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025. \r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh \r\nWe have reviewed our files and located the attached documents that are responsive to your request.\u00a0 Although the TPIA allows a governmental body to charge for copying documents, the attached is provided to you at no charge. \r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, you may contact me at 210-458-7500 / 210-458-4105 or via email at publicinfo@utsa.edu. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Kathleen Blanton Open Records Manager \r\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio \r\nOffice of Legal Affairs - Open Records \r\nwww.utsa.edu/openrecords **If you wish to make or amend an open records request to UTSA you may do so online at www.utsa.edu/openrecords.**",
