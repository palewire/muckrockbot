Miles, who was killed in the line of duty as a Customs Agent for the U.S. Treasury Department in Arizona on February 21, 1986. This request includes, but is not limited to any FBI lab analysis of Agent Miles' handheld audio recorder, or references to its contents, as well as any 302s or field reports regarding Agent Miles' potential interactions with the alleged drug traffickers who were reportedly involved in his murder. Finally, this request includes any records sent or received by FBI to William Laverty, U.S. Customs Attache at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City regarding the July 1986 arrest of five Mexican nationals in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico who were alleged to have been involved with the slaying.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
