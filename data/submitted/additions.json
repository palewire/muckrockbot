        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nAs background information, on 4/22/2022, I submitted a request with tracking number  NARA-NGC-2022-001048. I requested all emails to or from NARA from the external domain @dp.la. This was eventually rejected as overly broad\u2014which I object to, as my belief is it would only have amounted to a few dozen emails, and I was given no answer to my follow up to understand the difficulty. In any case, in the rejection from NARA, the following was stated:\r\n\r\n\"However, the requester needs to be specific in identifying the type of record; the topic or subject covered by the record, and an approximate date for the record. The FOIA does not require agencies to conduct research, answer questions, or analyze data. Your request does not give the information necessary to identify potentially Federal responsive records. Could you please provide a specific department (within NARA) that you believe may have communicated with the organization cited in your FOIA request?\"\r\n\r\nIn response, I would like to narrow/reformulate my request to emails with specific keywords found only in emails to/from specific NARA staff email addresses, within a limited date range. Please see this more limited list of 10 NARA employees:\r\n\r\n* Hannah Bergman <hannah.bergman@nara.gov>\r\n* Jason Clingerman <jason.clingerman@nara.gov>\r\n* David Ferriero <david.ferriero@nara.gov> or <archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov>\r\n* Valorie Findlater <valorie.findlater@nara.gov>\r\n* Carol Lagundo <carol.lagundo@nara.gov>\r\n* Maureen MacDonald <maureen.macdonald@nara.gov>\r\n* Gary M. Stern <garym.stern@nara.gov>\r\n* Debra Wall <debra.wall@nara.gov>\r\n* Andrew Wilson <andrew.wilson@nara.gov>\r\n* Pamela Wright <pamela.wright@nara.gov>\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All emails, including attachments, sent to or from the above listed NARA staff members, from the period of August 1, 2019 to December 31 , 2020 which contain the terms \"Digital Public Library of America\" or \"DPLA\".\r\n\r\n2. Google Chat messages from the same individuals and same time frame with the matching search terms, as well as the 10 messages occurring before or after them (to capture the context).\r\n\r\nBecause NARA is a member of the association being searched for, I have reason to believe there will be responsive records. I do not believe the number will be excessive, because this is not a major component of NARA's work, but if you still believe the request needs to be narrowed, despite the very specific ways in which I have already given parameters for the document search, then I would appreciate additional details as to what makes it excessive (e.g. if a search was done and what the number of emails was).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTR",
