        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nBy way of background: \r\n\r\nAt some point near the end of 2024, NARA published a report titled \"2024 Update for Reparative Description\" at <https://www.archives.gov/research/reparative-description/update-2024>.  (This page has since been removed.) The update states NARA \"moved reparative description work from a temporary working group to incorporating reparative description into the regular description processes of the agency\". The page makes reference to various processes and training materials, for which it is reasonable to assume there will be records. Specifically, NARA wrote:\r\n\r\n1. \"We are incorporating reparative description training into the regular agency-wide training program for the staff who work on description.\"\r\n2. \"We developed and implemented processes for terms to be identified and recommendations for updating to be submitted by staff or the public for consideration.\"\r\n3. \"We developed the process for our standards board to review submissions and provide final recommendations for the Archivist.\"\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of any \"reparative description training\" materials referenced at the above web page. If they are embedded within a larger web page, document, PDF, slide deck, or video, the entire training document is requested. This request for the version of the materials which is being referenced at the time of the publication of the undated Update above. If it cannot be determined anymore what the publication date is, December 31, 2024.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the agency policy, guidelines, memo, or other documents which were referred to when NARA described that it had developed \"processes for terms to be identified and recommendations for updating\".\r\n\r\n3.  A copy of the agency policy, guidelines, memo, or other documents which were referred to when NARA described that it had developed \"the process for our standards board to review submissions and provide final recommendations\"\r\n\r\n4. Copies of any such recommendations made to the Archivist by the NARA Lifecycle Data Standards Board under the above cited process, both approved and rejected (if any). Or if they were tracked in a spreadsheet or similar single document with information about the recommendations and the Archivist's responses, this is preferable to conducting a search of emails.\r\n\r\n5. As pertains to the process(es) outlined in request #2 & #3 above, I also request a copy of the CURRENT authorized version of the operative agency policy, if it has changed since it was described in the statement in the 2024 Update. Or, if it was rescinded, any memo or record indicating such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of any charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDarren Barton-McDougall",
