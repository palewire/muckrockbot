        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nATTENTION:\r\n\r\nThe Government Spying Transparency Project (GSTP) submit this expedited Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI') pertaining to the investigation and surveillance of Muslim communities in Washington. The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Washington from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Washington. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Seattle FBI Field Office, Washington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Public Works ,\r\n\r\nThis is a new Immediate Disclosure Request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance, made before start of business August 22, 2019. \r\n\r\n** Please redact your responses correctly! This is a public mailbox, and all of your responses (including emails, attachments, file shares, and the disclosed records) may be automatically and instantly available to the general public on the MuckRock.com service used to issue this request (though I am not a MuckRock representative). Once you send them to us, there's no going back. **\r\n\r\nThe audio record of the August 7 SOTF meeting appears to reference a \"Custodian of Records Working Group\" (aka \"Custodian Working Group\", called the \"Group\" below) of public employees attempting to, among other things, lobby (in a colloquial sense), via a letter, the SOTF to impose certain suggestions or restrictions on the behavior of the public.  Perhaps my impression is incorrect; I would like to know more.\r\n\r\nI request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance (Ordinance) and the California Public Records Act (CPRA):\r\n\r\n1. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all agendas (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n2. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all minutes (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n3. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all listings of the membership/roster of the Group\r\n4. regular request: all supporting documentation used at meetings of the Group\r\n5. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records showing any budget allocations or other financial support given to the Group\r\n6. regular request: all records that would demonstrate the public monies being used to support the activities of the Group (including showing the time spent by public employees performing Group work, for example calendar/schedule items showing when the meetings took place and who attended).  Ms. Blackman said [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that the signers spent \"quite a lot of time\" was spent writing this letter.  Provide all records showing what public employee work time was spent writing this letter.\r\n7. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records related to the attempt to lobby the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force to change their rules or procedures, including but not limited to the letter discussed at the SOTF Aug 7 meeting.  Including a copy of the letter and all drafts or other versions of this letter.\r\n8. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and the Group as an entity\r\n9. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and any of { David Steinberg, Sue Blackman, Hank Heckel, Caroline Celaya, Marianne Mazzucco-Thompson } since Jan. 1, 2019.\r\n10. regular request: Ms. Celaya stated [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that certain best practices have been generated.  Provide all policies/best practices written by the Group.\r\n\r\nWe remind you of your obligations to provide electronic records in any format we request them in, as long as either you hold them in that format, the format is available to you, or the format is easy to generate (Admin Code 67.21(l)). Therefore, calendars exported in the .ics, iCalendar, or vCard formats (\"A\") and emails exported in the .eml or .msg formats (\"B\") with all non-exempt headers, metadata, attachments, etc. are our desired formats.  Such formats are easily exportable from Google Calendar/Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or other common calendaring/email systems.  However, if you choose to convert electronic calendar items, for example, to PDF or printed format, to easily redact them, you must ensure that you have preserved the full content of the original calendar item record (as specified in requests 1 and 2), which contains many detailed headers beyond the ones generally printed out.  If you provide PDFs or printed items with only a few of the headers or lacking attachments/images, and therefore withhold the other headers/attachments without justification, you may be in violation of SF Admin Code 67.21, 67.26, 67.27, Govt Code 6253(a), 6253.9, and/or 6255, and we may challenge your decision.  We *do not* waive the requirement of 67.21(l) discussed above, and are merely instructing you to preserve information even if you provide to us the undesirable PDF format.\r\n\r\nFor word processing documents, either .docx or .pdf formats are fine.  For physical items, scanning to PDF format is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor this request, we are asking for a City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017) search be performed of the Compliance Officer/Custodian of Records/Public Records Manager and all other members of your department's staff who are a member of or have ever attended the Group, such that each such employee either provide all records responsive to this request present on their personal accounts/devices/property (solely to the extent the record or portion thereof relates to the public's business), or provide a declaration/affidavit that no such records exist.  All such affidavits/declarations are also requested as responsive records to this request.  Please handle the government account record search as an immediate disclosure search, and the personal search under regular timelines.\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.  Please use email for all responses.  I will not use any third-party records management private company's website, and I cannot be required to do so.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous",

Because you included a combination of standard and immediate disclosure requests, we have split the request into separate  items, which we have logged as Public Records Request #19-3455 and Public Records Request #19-3456.\r\n\r\nFor Public Records Request #19-3455, you have requested the following records:\r\n\r\n  *   IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all agendas (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n  *   IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all minutes (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n  *   IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all listings of the membership/roster of the Group\r\n  *   IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records showing any budget allocations or other financial support given to the Group\r\n  *   IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records related to the attempt to lobby the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force to change their rules or procedures, including but not limited to the letter discussed at the SOTF Aug 7 meeting. Including a copy of the letter and all drafts or other versions of this letter.\r\n\r\nFor Public Records Request #19-3456, you have requested the following records:\r\n\r\n  *   regular request: all supporting documentation used at meetings of the Group\r\n  *   regular request: all records that would demonstrate the public monies being used to support the activities of the Group (including showing the time spent by public employees performing Group work, for example calendar/schedule items showing when the meetings took place and who attended).

You will receive an email from Nextrequest.com with instructions for setting up an account and following up on this request. In the future, please make requests for Public Works records online at: http://sfpublicworks.org/records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur department will identify and compile the requested information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Public Records Request #19-3455, the Sunshine Ordinance requires departments to respond to an Immediate Disclosure Request no later than the close of business the next business day. Therefore, we will contact you as soon as the responsive documents are ready for you to view and will do so on or before Aug. 23, as permitted by San Francisco Administrative Code \u00a7 67.25(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Public Records Request #19-3456, the Sunshine Ordinance requires departments to respond as soon as possible or within 10 calendar days from receipt of any records requests.

In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous",

Thanks again. I have submitted the following written public comment to the SOTF agenda re: this request:\r\n\r\n==== Begin\r\nAnonymous requester would like to thank and commend David Steinberg, Custodian of Records, Public Works, for his and its professionalism and thoroughness in responding to an immediate disclosure request about the Custodian Working Group.\r\n\r\nIn less than one business day, Mr. Steinberg published online over 100 raw emails and other documents in their native format, metadata, and headers, without contention. In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 23, 2019:\r\nSubject: [External Message Added] San Francisco public records request #19-3456\r\nSan Francisco\r\n\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\nHi there\r\n\r\nA message was sent to you regarding record request #19-3456:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI just realized that yesterday when I responded to this request, I  inadvertently neglected to release the responsive records to you, I have released them now.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the records released yesterday in response to Public Records Request #19-3455 may also be responsive to this request.Because you submitted a single request that I entered as two requests in NextRequest to ensure I met the IDR deadlines, I did not duplicate such files here.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid A.

Immediate Disclosure Request\r\nDear SOTF,\r\n\r\nI do not know if your full task force meeting's public comment / agenda section allows a submission of written comment. If it does, I would like to include the following 3 paragraph, 109 word comment in writing for whatever is your next task force meeting's agenda:\r\n\r\n==== Begin\r\nAnonymous requester would like to thank and commend David Steinberg, Custodian of Records, Public Works, for his and its professionalism and thoroughness in responding to an immediate disclosure request about the Custodian Working Group.\r\n\r\nIn less than one business day, Mr. Steinberg published online over 100 raw emails and other documents in their native format, metadata, and headers, without contention. In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThere is no complaint, just a comment.\r\n\r\nWhile I am happy to call in to the meeting's accessible bridge conference call to make that public comment if so required, unless I happen to be presenting a case, it seems like it would be a lot of extra work for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 22, 2019:\r\nSubject: California Public Records Act Request: Custodian of Records Working Group - Immediate Disclosure Request\r\nDear Department of Public Works ,\r\n\r\nThis is a new Immediate Disclosure Request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance, made before start of business August 22, 2019.\r\n\r\n** Please redact your responses correctly! This is a public mailbox, and all of your responses (including emails, attachments, file shares, and the disclosed records) may be automatically and instantly available to the general public on the MuckRock.com service used to issue this request (though I am not a MuckRock representative). Once you send them to us, there's no going back. **\r\n\r\nThe audio record of the August 7 SOTF meeting appears to reference a \"Custodian of Records Working Group\" (aka \"Custodian Working Group\", called the \"Group\" below) of public employees attempting to, among other things, lobby (in a colloquial sense), via a letter, the SOTF to impose certain suggestions or restrictions on the behavior of the public. Perhaps my impression is incorrect; I would like to know more.\r\n\r\nI request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance (Ordinance) and the California Public Records Act (CPRA):\r\n\r\n1. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all agendas (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n2. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all minutes (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n3. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all listings of the membership/roster of the Group\r\n4. regular request: all supporting documentation used at meetings of the Group\r\n5. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records showing any budget allocations or other financial support given to the Group\r\n6. regular request: all records that would demonstrate the public monies being used to support the activities of the Group (including showing the time spent by public employees performing Group work, for example calendar/schedule items showing when the meetings took place and who attended). Ms. Blackman said [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that the signers spent \"quite a lot of time\" was spent writing this letter. Provide all records showing what public employee work time was spent writing this letter.\r\n7. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records related to the attempt to lobby the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force to change their rules or procedures, including but not limited to the letter discussed at the SOTF Aug 7 meeting. Including a copy of the letter and all drafts or other versions of this letter.\r\n8. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and the Group as an entity\r\n9. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and any of { David Steinberg, Sue Blackman, Hank Heckel, Caroline Celaya, Marianne Mazzucco-Thompson } since Jan. 1, 2019.\r\n10. regular request: Ms. Celaya stated [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that certain best practices have been generated. Provide all policies/best practices written by the Group.\r\n\r\nWe remind you of your obligations to provide electronic records in any format we request them in, as long as either you hold them in that format, the format is available to you, or the format is easy to generate (Admin Code 67.21(l)). Therefore, calendars exported in the .ics, iCalendar, or vCard formats (\"A\") and emails exported in the .eml or .msg formats (\"B\") with all non-exempt headers, metadata, attachments, etc. are our desired formats. Such formats are easily exportable from Google Calendar/Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or other common calendaring/email systems. However, if you choose to convert electronic calendar items, for example, to PDF or printed format, to easily redact them, you must ensure that you have preserved the full content of the original calendar item record (as specified in requests 1 and 2), which contains many detailed headers beyond the ones generally printed out. If you provide PDFs or printed items with only a few of the headers or lacking attachments/images, and therefore withhold the other headers/attachments without justification, you may be in violation of SF Admin Code 67.21, 67.26, 67.27, Govt Code 6253(a), 6253.9, and/or 6255, and we may challenge your decision. We *do not* waive the requirement of 67.21(l) discussed above, and are merely instructing you to preserve information even if you provide to us the undesirable PDF format.\r\n\r\nFor word processing documents, either .docx or .pdf formats are fine. For physical items, scanning to PDF format is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor this request, we are asking for a City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017) search be performed of the Compliance Officer/Custodian of Records/Public Records Manager and all other members of your department's staff who are a member of or have ever attended the Group, such that each such employee either provide all records responsive to this request present on their personal accounts/devices/property (solely to the extent the record or portion thereof relates to the public's business), or provide a declaration/affidavit that no such records exist. All such affidavits/declarations are also requested as responsive records to this request. Please handle the government account record search as an immediate disclosure search, and the personal search under regular timelines.\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose. Please use email for all responses. I will not use any third-party records management private company's website, and I cannot be required to do so.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 79194-43289608@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:79194-43289608@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?url_auth_token=AAA14sR-yHY0_oqA8gf2otYwhbo%3A1i8Ky7%3A0ghjIFFvIxVBkn00LHTlIqDUwuI&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdepartment-of-public-works-4835%252Fcustodian-of-records-working-group-immediate-disclosure-request-79194%252F%253Femail%253Ddavid.steinberg%252540sfdpw.org\r\nIs this email coming to the wrong contact?

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the use of body cameras, including:\r\n  a. policies or procedures governing use of body cameras;\r\n  b. what types of data are obtained;\r\n  c. the conditions under which body cameras are used;\r\n  d. the frequency of body camera use;\r\n  e. the number of body camera units or systems acquired;\r\n  f. the number of officers equipped with body cameras;\r\n\r\n2. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the review of body camera data by supervising officers or staff or civilian review personnel to ensure officer compliance with department or agency policies and applicable state and federal law;\r\n\r\n3. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the sharing of data obtained through body cameras, including:\r\n  a. what type of data is shared;\r\n  b. what databases your agency puts collected body camera data into; and\r\n  c. third parties, governmental or private, that may access your agency's body camera data, including what procedures a third party must go through to access the data and any restrictions placed on a third party regarding further sharing of your body camera data;\r\n\r\n6. All agreements to share body camera data with outside agencies or departments, corporations, or other entities; and\r\n\r\n7. All training materials used to instruct members of your department or agency in body camera deployment, data management, or operation of automated records systems that contain body camera data to which any member of your department or agency has access, including regional or shared databases.\r\n\r\nIf this records request is denied in whole or in part, please provide (1) whether the documents in question exists, and if so, (2) the statutory exemption you are claiming prevents their release. If Jackson Police Department claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. If possible, I prefer that the records be produced in electronic format.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlake Feldman",

What I got so far is nowhere near what I expected. Out of those 23,300 emails I get maybe 5 or six?\r\nSo far I received maybe 4 cases from different staff. I am hoping that there are more coming.\r\nI am amazed that there is nothing that pertains to the last meetings we had with you , John, David and myself. Is this going to be disclosed?

The district did not locate any email records for the years 2015 or 2016.\r\n\r\nThe files are too large to send through the district email system. I have placed them in a shared Google folder at this link<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PG3SXovIyg7A-475Ea6JzYdzjISNrxzv?usp=drive_link>. You may access, view and download the records. Be sure to save them for your use. The file will remain accessible for 30 days.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions about the records.\r\n\r\nWith this response, the district considers this request closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTammy Bengen, Executive Assistant for\r\nAssistant Superintendent Equity, Engagement & Academics and\r\nAssistant Superintendent Business, Human Resources & Technology\r\n9401 Sharon Dr. | Everett, WA 98204\r\nbengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu<mailto:bengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu>\n",

An exemption log accompanies the records.\r\n\r\nThe files are too large to send through the district's email system. I have created a shared folder at this link<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wGXqj7enuup-BlaZR4u4CYxu3x6Gzx6Y?usp=sharing>. You may access, review and download the documents. Besides the email I am using to respond to your request, I have shared the folder with the email address sitesra47@gmail.com<mailto:sitesra47@gmail.com>. Please be sure to save copies of the records for your use. The folder will remain active for 30 days or through November 3, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the records, please let me know.\r\n\r\nWith this response, the district considers this request closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTammy Bengen, Executive Assistant for\r\nAssistant Superintendent Equity, Engagement & Academics and\r\nAssistant Superintendent Business, Human Resources & Technology\r\n9401 Sharon Dr. | Everett, WA 98204\r\nbengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu<mailto:bengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu>\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Stanley Aronowitz.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
