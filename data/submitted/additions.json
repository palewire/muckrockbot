There does not appear to be a statute in CT for obstruction of justice per se, however, the crimes may fall under threatening or harassment.  My complaint to the Stratford Police and Court filings detail the nature of the threats against my active participation in multiple matters in the Stratford Probate Court.  Because the threats involved multiple CT police departments and the interstate transmission/cooperation between police agencies in Ct and Arizona, a laundry list of federal crimes may have been committed related to this issue.\r\n\r\nThe filings in the Stratford Probate Court have detailed information and are located at the muckrock website here,\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_request_attachments/s_huminski%40live.com/148926/4_filing_merge_7-17-2023.pdf\r\n\r\nFOIA requests have been filed with the police departments involved which also contain this data; Wilton CT, Norwalk CT, Gilbert AZ.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage, I realize that you may only have initial information concerning the complaint filed with your department.  Please provide.  I will also attach a copy of the court filings to this request which also contains copies of the emails sent to your agency as a formal criminal complaint.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be processed by a representative of the news media/press and made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nscott huminski",
