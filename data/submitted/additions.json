We request a waiver of any fees or costs associated with this request.\r\n\r\nThis request concerns a matter of public interest. It is important that we access these public records in order to effectively advocate for students and staff at the {agency name}. The records are not sought for a commercial or personal interest, but rather for the purpose of providing the public with information concerning civil liberties in higher education. \r\n\r\nIf you elect to charge a fee, please provide a cost estimate for each category of documents requested. Please also provide me with a W-9 form.\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing: The records pertain to a matter of public importance and current debate. Providing expedited production of the records will facilitate the public understanding of these matters before they are fully resolved. Any undue delay in production will undermine the purpose of the public records laws, which serve to allow public input and oversight of government affairs. In any event, {short name} law requires that a request be acted upon in {days} days.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if any specific categories of requested records will require a significantly longer production time than those in other categories, please provide records for each category on a piecemeal basis as they become available. \r\n\r\nRequest for Privilege Log: If any otherwise responsive documents are withheld on the basis that they are privileged or fall within a statutory exemption, please provide a privilege log setting forth (1) the subject matter of the document; (2) the person(s) who sent and received the document; (3) the date the document was created or sent; and (4) the basis on which the document is withheld.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of assistance in interpreting or narrowing this request, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n{name}\r\n\r\nCharlotte Arneson\r\nProgram Counsel, Campus Rights Advocacy \r\nFoundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE)\r\n700 Pennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, Suite 340\r\nWashington, D.C. 20003\r\nPh: 215-717-3473 ext. 263\r\nthefire.org",
