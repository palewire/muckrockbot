I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

        "communication": "BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2019) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2019\r\n\r\nVia email: publicrecords@bsd405.org\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.\tI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of FBI file 29B-WF-171994 as well as copies of any files whose\r\n    numbers appear in 29B-WF-171994.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The city is providing records containing information regarding the incident identified in your request as required by Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a07923.610 and 7923.615. The city has redacted the full name of the juvenile victims in this case pursuant to Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a07922.000, 7927.705 and 7930.100 (Cal. Const., Art. I, \u00a7\u00a01,\u00a0and Art 1, \u00a7 28). Pursuant to Cal Gov Code\u00a0\u00a7 7922.000, the city has determined that the public interest served by not disclosing the full names of the victims clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure because the rights of victims of crime and their families in criminal prosecutions are a subject of grave statewide concern and crime victims are entitled to privacy and to be treated with respect and dignity. The crime victims\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy and respect clearly outweighs the public\u2019s interest in obtaining the full last name of juvenile victims of a crime that occurred 13 years ago. To the extent this is a denial of your request, Assistant City Attorney Allegra Frost is responsible for that denial. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 442-339-2808. \r\nSincerely, \r\nFaviola Medina \r\nCity Clerk Services Manager \r\nCity Clerk Services",

I request all such documents generated on or after  January 1, 2016.\r\n\r\nIf this agency maintains other collective bargaining agreements with unions representing contractors, sub-contractors, or other non-direct employees, please provide a copy of those agreements as well for the same time period.\r\n\r\n If there are ways to modify or change the scope of my request to reduce the burden on agency resources, please let me know. If over the past six months you\u2019ve responded to another requester with information on contracts that likely covers substantially similar material and re-releasing that same material instead of a new search reduces the burden on agency resources, please let me know and I\u2019m happy to consider accepting that instead of requiring a new search.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and the request is made in the process of public policy research news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe information that you are seeking can be found in NR #23-5227.

Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the Miami-Dade Department of Education to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Florida Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records under the Florida Sunshine Law. One key case is Times Publishing Co. v. Williams, 222 So. 2d 470 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969), which held that the public has a right to access government records and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County v. Dain, 719 So. 2d 1063 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998), which held that a government agency must provide a specific justification for withholding or redacting information under an exemption to the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the decision-making process behind the banning or removal of books from schools due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this decision-making process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to any complaints or challenges made against books due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any correspondence or communication between the Miami-Dade Department of Education and individuals or groups involved in such challenges or complaints.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting a list of all books that have been banned or removed from schools in Florida due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Please provide the title, author, and reason for the banning or removal of each book.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

The staff of the Office of Academics and Transformation has provided my office with the three attached records relative to your request. Staff has advised these books were removed due to inappropriate content for age group.\r\n\r\n* A Court of Mist and Fury\r\n* Daddy's Roommate\r\n* Fates and Furies\r\n\r\nThese books were neither objected to, nor challenged. However, through an audit, they were identified as being inappropriate due to the adult content and sexually charged language utilized throughout the books. Attached are the reviews from Follet's Titlewave platform that identifies the books as either being Adult or Young Adult (Age 17) in nature. Note that Daddy's Roommate is now an archived title in Titlewave and therefore may be removed from libraries. These books were only located in four of our libraries, and the singular copies were weeded out.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, staff has advised there are no records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to any complaints or challenges made against books due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes as no challenges or complaints have been filed to-date.\r\n\r\nM-DCPS does not maintain a record of all books that have been banned or removed from schools in Florida due to any circumstances or criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlissa S.

Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioral health services provisions at all locations where adults are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for adult inmates.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioral health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of the adult justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

Your request was received in this office on 4/6/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.

        "communication": "April 15, 2020 RE:\u00a0 USAID FOIA No. F-00177-20 (FOIA Specialist Assignment Email) Dear Mr. Freudenthal: This acknowledges receipt of your\u00a0April 15, 2020, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\u00a0to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \u00a0Specifically, you requested all the drafts or final reports of audits and/or investigations and/or desk reviews undertaken by the Office of the Inspector General on the response to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo and all reports of the visit by a delegation of senior U.S. officials to the Democratic Republic of Congo to assess the response to the outbreak. (Date Range for Record Search: From 1/1/2019 To 1/15/2020). \nThe FOIA provides that fees should be waived or reduced if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u00a0 As a member of the media, the only applicable fee is duplication.\u00a0 Duplication is $0.10 per page, but the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 After review of the fee waiver criteria, your fee waiver request is moot.\u00a0 Since the only applicable fee is duplication, and USAID routinely furnishes responsive records to FOIA requesters in electronic format, it's most likely there will be no duplication fees to assess. \nFOIA Specialist \nYour request has been assigned to Adam Abdi, Program Manager/Senior FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Adam Abdi\u00a0by email at aabdi@usaid.gov or by phone on 202-916-4664. \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. \nExtending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov. \n\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.

You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request. \r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests. \u00a0The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process. \u00a0The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process. \u00a0The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process. \u00a0The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process. \u00a0The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable. \u00a0Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis. \r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track. \u00a0There are 13 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue. \u00a0Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by August 3, 2023. \r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov. \r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. \u00a0Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. \u00a0You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: \r\nOffice of Government Information Services \r\nNational Archives and Records Administration \r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS \r\nCollege Park, MD\u00a0 20740-6001 \r\nTelephone: \u00a0(202) 741-5770 \r\nFax: \u00a0(202) 741-5769 \r\nToll-free: \u00a01 (877) 684-6448 \r\nE-mail:\u00a0 ogis@nara.gov \r\nWeb: https://www.archives.gov/ogis (https://www.archives.gov/ogis) \r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer. Contact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters. \r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact me by email at foia@usgs.gov. \r\nSincerely, \r\nEric J.

(https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-dhs-cell-phone-data-tracking-geolocation) \r\n\r\nAccording to the article: \"The agency is aware of potential legal vulnerabilities under the Fourth Amendment. Mizelle states in his memo that there are ways for CBP and ICE to \u201cminimize the risk\u201d of possible constitutional violations, pointing out that they could limit their searches to defined periods, require supervisors to sign off on lengthy searches, only use the data when more \u201ctraditional\u201d techniques fail, and limit the tracking of one device to when there is \u201cindividualized suspicion\u201d or relevance to a \u201claw enforcement investigation.\u201d\"\r\n\r\nAs a journalist publishing with The Atlantic, The New Republic, NBC News, Bloomberg News and other national publications, I request this information in the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTanvi Misra",

Your request is granted in part. After a thorough review of the responsive records, we have determined that portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemptions (b)(5) of the FOIA 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, as amended and delineated below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Exemption (b)(5) permits the withholding of inter-agency or intra-agency communications records which are part of the deliberative process and pre-decisional.  Disclosure of such material could inhibit the open and candid expression of opinions and diminish the quality of the decision-making process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining to withhold such information, FDA considered 5 USC 552(a)(8)(i), when applicable, and whether FDA reasonably foresees that disclosure of such information would harm an interest protected by the relevant exemption(s) and whether disclosure is prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nCFSAN considers your request closed.  You have the right to appeal this determination. Your appeal should clearly identify the agency determination that is being appealed. It would be helpful if you provide specific reasons explaining why you believe the agency's adverse determination should be reconsidered. By filing an appeal, you preserve your rights under FOIA and give the agency a chance to review and reconsider your request and the agency's decision.  Your appeal must be mailed within 90 days from the date of this response, to: Director, Office of the Executive Secretariat, U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1050, Rockville, MD 20857, or emailed within 90 days from the date of this response to FDAFOIA@fda.hhs.gov<mailto:FDAFOIA@fda.hhs.gov>.  Please clearly mark both the envelope and your letter \"FDA Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss our response before filing an appeal to attempt to resolve your dispute without going through the appeals process, please contact Dillon.Ainsworth@fda.hhs.gov<mailto:Dillon.Ainsworth@fda.hhs.gov> or by telephone 240-402-1947. You may also contact the FDA FOIA Public Liaison for assistance at: Office of the Executive Secretariat, US Food & Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1050, Rockville, MD 20857, E-mail: FDAFOIA@fda.hhs.gov<mailto:FDAFOIA@fda.hhs.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to resolve your FOIA dispute through our FOIA Public Liaison, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), the Federal FOIA Ombudsman's office, offers mediation services to help resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies. The contact information for OGIS is as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, MD 20740-6001; telephone at  202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769;  e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit payment until you receive an invoice.

All emails to/from/between former California Dept. of Public Health Director Sonia Angell and any email address originating from, or ending in, \" @mckinsey.com \" between the dates of 3/1/2020 and 8/31/2020.\r\n2. All emails to/from/between former California Dept. of Public Health Interim Director Sandra Shewry and any email address originating from, or ending in, \" @mckinsey.com \" between the dates of 8/1/2020 and 12/31/2020.\r\n3. All emails to/from/between California Dept. of Public Health Director Tomas J. Aragon and any email address originating from, or ending in, \" @mckinsey.com \" between the dates of 12/1/2020 and 6/1/2021.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible for your agency to conduct a search for emails originating from a specific domain, such as @mckinsey.com, please let me know and I can provide you with a specific list of McKinsey email addresses to search for instead.\r\n\r\nMcKinsey & Co. is a global management consulting firm whose work regarding various government responses to COVID-19, including vaccination efforts, have come under scrutiny recently in the U.S. (https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mckinsey-is-making-100-million-and-counting-advising-on-the-governments-bumbling-coronavirus-response) and in France (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html). The firm's government contracts were also the subject of a recent public records lawsuit in Tennessee (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tennessee-sued-not-releasing-covid-221610057.html). McKinsey & Co. also recently came under scrutiny in the national press over potential conflicts of interest related to the firm's relationships with pharmaceutical companies and regulators (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/business/mckinsey-purdue-fda-records.html). \r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, the State of California had contracts with McKinsey and Company, which are disclosed on the state's COVID-19 contract disclosure website: https://covid19.ca.gov/contracts/\r\n\r\nBased on that information, fully understanding how CDPH and State officials interacted with McKinsey & Co. when developing California's COVID-19 response, including the information and advice that was provided to CDPH and State officials by McKinsey & Co. regarding COVID-19, is of the highest importance to the public. The requested information should be made available to the public with as few redactions as possible, and at the lowest fee possible, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen providing the records related to this request, please specifically certify that no other responsive documents related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and/or activities of the government, and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work is published regularly by print and digital news outlets and magazines. You can view my portfolio at www.erinmariemiller.com/clips. I have previously been determined a media requester by federal agencies in other FOIA requests. As a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. In the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If the fee for this request exceeds this amount, please notify me in writing for permission prior to beginning work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nPlease send all documents related to this request to this email address.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

The firm's government contracts were also the subject of a recent public records lawsuit in Tennessee (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tennessee-sued-not-releasing-covid-221610057.html).

Aragon, M.D. Dr. P.H \r\n Director and State Public Health Officer  California Department of Public Health Gavin Newsom, Governor \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThank you for contacting the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to obtain public records. \r\nYour Public Records Act (PRA) request dated January 31, 2023, is being processed.\u00a0 Reference Number P017708-013123 has been assigned for tracking purposes.\u00a0 Please refer to this reference number for use when accessing the CDPH Public Records Center Portal to monitor the progress of your request. \r\nCDPH strives to answer all requests for public records in as timely a manner as possible.\u00a0 Under California law, CDPH must respond to your inquiry no later than ten calendar days from receipt of the request to notify you whether records will be disclosed.\u00a0 \u00a0Note that some records are exempted from disclosure.\u00a0 If the requested records are exempt, we will inform you in writing as to why. \r\nThe Public Records Act (see Govt. Code \u00a76250 et. seq.) provides that CDPH may extend the response period for up to 14 calendar days should it be necessary to search for records located at off-site facilities or if the request involves a voluminous amount of records.\u00a0 We will notify you within 10 days of receipt of your request if a 14-day extension is necessary.\u00a0 If fees are involved, CDPH will need to collect the fees before releasing the records.\u00a0 However, there is typically no fee for records released electronically through the Public Records Center Portal. \r\nThe 10- and 14-day response periods are to allow CDPH time to determine how long it will take to disclose the requested records.\u00a0 Depending on the number of records requested or other factors, a response may take longer.\u00a0 CDPH will do its best to provide documents on a rolling basis as they become available and to keep you informed as to the timing and type of records to be released. \r\nPlease visit the CDPH Public Records Center Portal\u00a0to monitor request progress, communicate with CDPH staff processing your request and to submit future requests.\r\nCalifornia Department of Public Health",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",
