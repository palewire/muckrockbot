Any aggregate summaries, tracking records, or reports the University maintains that reflect how ORS 659A University-administered safe leave has been administered over time.\r\n\r\n4. Identification of where the University has posted or maintained the notices required under ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283, including:\r\n\r\n   - physical posting locations,\r\n   - electronic locations where those notices have been made available to employees (including remote employees), and\r\n   - the dates those notices were in effect at those locations.\r\n\r\n5. Any records, guidance, training materials, or communications indicating that:\r\n\r\n   - certain qualifying purposes were treated as atypical or outside normal use,\r\n   - eligibility was evaluated based on the nature of the allegation or proceeding rather than the statutory criteria, or\r\n   - certification from a health-care or service provider was considered insufficient under ORS 659A.280.\r\n\r\n6. A year-by-year numerical summary of the number of times the University notified complainants who alleged they were victims of conduct covered by ORS 659A.272 of the availability of University-administered safe leave protections, as required under the notice obligations set forth in ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283, including:\r\n\r\n    - the office providing the notice (e.g., OEOA/OICRC, Human Resources, HR Leaves, Workplace ADA, Employee & Labor Relations, or other),\r\n    - the category of qualifying conduct or bias identified (reported only by category and count),\r\n    - any records or aggregate data reflecting whether notification or access to safe leave was tracked, administered, or categorized differently based on the type of alleged bias (for example, disability-related complaints, ADA retaliation, race,       \r\n       sex/gender, or other protected categories), and\r\n    - any aggregate records reflecting how or when such notice was provided as part of complaint or response processes pursuant to ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283.\r\n\r\n\r\nNames and identifying details are not requested and may be redacted.\r\n\r\nClarification regarding parallel processes:\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion, this public records request is submitted pursuant to Oregon Public Records Law only and does not waive, replace, or otherwise affect any requests, grievances, or RFIs I have submitted through my union or any other employment-related process, many of which remain pending.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted because I require timely access to records necessary to understand my statutory protections and to plan accordingly. The public records process is the only mechanism currently available to obtain this information within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records electronically. If the information is maintained in summary or report form, those summaries are sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",

If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the way state allocated funds are being spent. I am a student journalist working on a large scale project dealing with the funds allocated to the state of West Virginia from the National Opioid Settlement. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. The West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. You can call me at 330-978-8228 or send me an email at jlr00026@mix.wvu.edu. My physical address is 1511 University Ave. Morgantown, WV, 26505.

They referred me to the City of San Francisco, stating that you own the vehicle.
