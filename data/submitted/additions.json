The public interest in understanding the activities of the Section and Team viz. Prigozhin (including investigation of atrocities) far outweighs any privacy interest for which a denial would be required. Further, the public interest in understanding the ongoing war on Ukraine call for the release of all records that can be reasonably segregated from exempt materials.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",
