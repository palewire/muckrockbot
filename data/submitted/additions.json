        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe public should have access to any unedited audio or visual recordings of ICE's enforcement operations in California between January 6, 2025 to the present. Since at least 2010, ICE has created and made public hundreds of videos of various internal agency operations, including arrests, detention, and removals. Recently ICE and accompanying agencies have released videos of operations in Los Angeles that have included a raid on MacArthur Park. Videographers accompanied the agency, and the content was shared across multiple platforms. Other operations have been videotaped and shared online by the agency.  On one publicly available website, ICE videographers have uploaded videos of agency actions. Given ICE's widespread practice of recording its operations, additional and unedited recordings of ICE operations in California likely exist but have not been made public. These videos contain important information about the tactics used when arresting noncitizens and whether ICE officers are acting in a manner consistent with ICE's own protocols and state and federal due process laws. Because these video and audio records contain information about a critical government function on a matter of significant public interest and concern, FOIA mandates their disclosure.\r\n\r\n1. Any audio or visual recordings of ICE operations, including arrests, detention, and removals, in California between January 6, 2025 to the present. \r\n\r\nThe Requestor\r\n\r\nJoey Scott and Jeremy Lindenfield are both journalists who work in news gathering, including written and visual reporting. Joey Scott is a freelance investigative journalist in Los Angeles. Jeremy Lindenfield is a journalist for Capital and Main news. \r\n\r\nFee Waiver \r\n\r\nThe Requestor seeks a full fee waiver on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and is \"likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). As set forth above, this request aims to further public understanding of ICE programs and practices that directly affect untold numbers of noncitizens as well as members of the public captured in video recordings of ICE enforcement actions. These policies and practices are of interest to the general public. \r\n\r\nThe public interest fee waiver provision \"is to be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.\" McClellan Ecologic Seepage Situation v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1284 (9th Cir. 1987). The relevant question is whether the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, good or bad. See judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Disclosure of the information and report sought is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the treatment of immigrants during enforcement actions. The requested records also relate directly to government operations, including the use and storage of video files that potentially implicate fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to privacy. The requested records also relate to the relationship between the federal government and private, for-profit contracted entities. \r\n\r\nThe records are not sought for commercial use, and the Requestor plans to disseminate the information disclosed through print and other media to the public at no cost. As demonstrated above, the Requestor has both the intent and ability to convey any information obtained through this request to the public and is therefore entitled to a full fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \r\n\r\nShould the request for a full fee waiver be denied, Requestor also seeks a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (\"fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... educational or noncommercial scientific institution ... or a representative of the news media\") and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(d)(1) (search fees shall not be charged to \"representatives of the news media\"). Requestor is a non-profit organization that intends to disseminate the information gathered by this request to the public at no cost, including through the Requestor's website and social media. The Requestor may publish a news story or other publication on the government's treatment of immigrants based on information gathered through this FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5. U.S.C. \u00a7 552, by independent journalists working in the capacity of news gathering (the \"Requestor\"). We seek records about enforcement and removal operations of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Specifically, this request seeks records pertaining to the agency's practice of engaging videographers and camera crews to film arrests, raids, and other enforcement actions. This request also seeks records regarding ICE's relationships with private filmmakers and production companies, and the agency's practice of granting private filmmakers access to observe and film agency operations. This request also seeks records regarding ICE's relationships with news outlets, members of the press, and social media influencers to grant them access to observe and film agency operations.  \r\n\r\nSince at least 2010, ICE has amassed hundreds of videos of various internal agency operations, including home arrests, workplace raids, and tours of immigration detention facilities. Since Trump took office, the use of videos and filming operations has skyrocketed. \r\n\r\nAccording to publicly available records, these videos are primarily created by Audiovisual Production Specialists employed by DHS or by freelance videographers hired by ICE and invited to \"ride-along\" when officers arrest, detain, and remove noncitizens. Further, according to the agency's website, videographers play a critical role in agency operations. During ICE operations, they are not passive observers; they are a \"part of the team.\"4 The raw footage they capture is edited into short films and promotional materials and uploaded for public consumption. On one publicly available website, ICE videographers have uploaded more than 300 videos of agency actions that capture the images of countless noncitizens and\r\nmembers of the general public. In addition to employing its own videographers and camera crews, ICE regularly contracts with independent filmmakers, documentarians, and multimedia production companies, granting them access to observe and record internal agency operations.8 Under ICE's standard contract agreement, these independent filmmakers and multimedia production companies must provide DHS with a copy of the final, fully edited footage.9 Access to the footage created by these independent filmmakers only expands ICE's film catalog of agency operations.\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling and urgent need to obtain records and inform the public about ICE's video recording practices, particularly ICE's practice of recording its operations in vulnerable communities. The practice of engaging videographers, journalists, or granting access to independent camera crews and news outlets to document ICE arrests and removal operations implicates the fundamental due process and privacy rights of the subjects of these operations and of countless bystanders captured in the background. These operations also foster a climate of fear and anguish in the communities where these government activities take place. \r\n\r\nThe public should have access to information about the circumstances in which ICE permits videographers employed by the government and those who contract with ICE to record arrests, detentions, and removals. The public should also have access to information about how ICE uses, retains, and shares the video footage it has. Because ICE's video recording practices concern a critical government function on a matter of significant public interest and concern, FOIA mandates its disclosure. \r\n\r\nFrom November 1, 2024 to present\r\n1. All documents, preserved in physical or electronic form, containing a combination of the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\na. \"film(ing)\" or \"video record(ing)\" or \"videographer,\" or \"camera crew\"; and\r\nb. \"field operation(s)\" or \"fugitive operation(s)\" or \"arrest\" or \"raid,\" or\r\n\"enforcement action\";\r\nc. \"RayBan(s)\"\r\nd. \"Bill Megulin\" \r\ne. \"Fox LA\" or \"Fox News LA\"or \"FoxLA\"\r\n\r\nFrom November 1, 2024 to the present, in the possession of the following custodians:\r\na. Any individual who held the title Division Chief, Digital Engagement, Immigration and\r\nCustoms Enforcement during the aforementioned time period;\r\nb. Any individual who held the title Chief of Visual Communications, Immigrations and\r\nCustoms Enforcement during the aforementioned time period;\r\nc. Any individual who has held the title of Deputy Field Office Director of the Dallas,\r\nEl Paso, Los Angeles, or Miami ICE Field Office during the aforementioned\r\ntime period;\r\ne. Any individual who has held the title of Assistant Field Office Director of the Dallas,\r\nEl Paso, Los Angeles, or Miami ICE Field Office during the aforementioned\r\ntime period; or\r\nf. Any Audio and Visual Production Specialist employed by the Department\r\nHomeland Security (DHS) during the aforementioned time period, including\r\nwithout limitation Todd Packard, Marshall Amey, James Truitt, Corey Bullard,\r\nBlackburn, or Ron Rogers.\r\n\r\n2. Any written communication preserved in electronic form, including e-mail correspondence and attached documents, containing a combination of the following terms:\r\na.\"video\" or \"footage\" or \"B-roll\"; and\r\nb. \"ride-along\" or \"field operation(s)\" or \"fugitive operation(s)\" or \"arrest\" or\r\n\"raid\";\r\n\r\n3. Any complete or signed \"DHS Multimedia Agreement,\" as defined in DHS Instructions 109-01-001, from November 1, 2024 to the present.\r\n\r\n4. Written communications preserved in electronic form, including e-mail correspondence\r\nand attached documents, containing the following phrases:\r\n\"proposed pilot\"; \"shooting schedule\"; \"outline of the production\"; or\r\n\"approved production\"; from November 1, 2025 to the present, in the possession of the following custodians:\r\nb. Brandon A. Montgomery, Director, DHS, Office of Multimedia Liaison; The current Director of DHS' Office of Multimedia Liaison; or Any individual who has held the title of Director of DHS' Office of Multimedia Liaison during the aforementioned time period.\r\n\r\nThe Requestor seeks a full fee waiver on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and is \"likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).
