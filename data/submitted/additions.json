His Civil War pension application #194530 was filed on 27 Jul 1874. Asahel was born on 28 Sep 1839 Chautauqua, NY and died on 17 May 1933 in Chicago, IL. He served with the Union Army as a Sergeant in Company D, 5th Wisconsin Infantry in the Civil War. He enlisted and mustered on 20 Aug 1864 and was discharged 15 May 1865. He appears in the U.S., Civil War Pension Index: General Index to Pension Files, 1861-1934. Because Asahel died after 1929, I am unable to order directly from NARA's eServices portal. Thank you in advance for your assistance with this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKenneth Marshall",
