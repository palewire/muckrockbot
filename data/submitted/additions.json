Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012)\r\n\r\nIV. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II) and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(e) based on the following compelling justifications:\r\n\r\nUrgency to Inform the Public: There is an urgent need to inform the public about federal government activity that could significantly impact First Amendment rights and public discourse. Content moderation directives from a newly-inaugurated administration constitute a matter of exceptional public interest.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications: This request concerns potential government actions that may directly impact constitutional rights\u2014specifically First Amendment protections regarding free speech and expression.\r\n\r\nHistorical Continuity Analysis: The requested records span both Trump administrations (2017-2021 and 2025-present), providing crucial historical context for understanding current policy decisions. This complete timeline is essential for identifying policy patterns, continuity, and evolution across both administrations. The public has a compelling interest in understanding whether the current administration's approach to content moderation represents a continuation of previous policies or a new direction.\r\n\r\nSignificant Media Interest: As an investigative journalist working on a series about government influence on digital speech, my reporting on this matter is of significant interest to the public\r\n\r\nMy research and writing encompass several articles that pertain to various public and private\r\ninstitutions. A sampling of my published articles includes analyses of civil asset forfeiture practices within\r\nvarious police departments, public schools' firewall policies and user groups, and communities standing\r\nup against bigotry and hate.\r\n\r\nThese articles can be found at the following links:\r\n1. New York City Police Department's Civil Asset Forfeiture Records: A Battle for Transparency\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/02/27/new-york-city-police-departments-civil-asset-\r\nforfeiture-records-a-battle-for-transparency/)\r\n\r\n2. Revealed: Miami Police Department's Civil Asset Forfeiture Practices Over the Past Decade\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/02/27/revealed-miami-police-departments-civil-asset-\r\nforfeiture-practices-over-the-past-decade/)\r\n\r\n3. Duval County Public Schools of Jacksonville, FL Releases Information on Firewall Policies and\r\nUsergroups\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/03/07/duval-county-public-schools-of-jacksonville-fl-\r\nreleases-information-on-firewall-policies-and-usergroups/)\r\n\r\n4. Roanoke Barrel Babes Drag Brunch: Standing Up Against Bigotry and Hate\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/03/23/roanoke-barrel-babes-drag-brunch-standing-up-\r\nagainst-bigotry-and-hate/)\r\n\r\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing reasons for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nV. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k), and judicial precedents including Cause of Action v. Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994) on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested information concerns identifiable operations and activities of the federal government\u2014specifically, actions taken by the DOJ regarding social media content moderation that may affect millions of Americans. As recognized in Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir. 2017), information about government policy formation processes substantially contributes to public understanding of government operations.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest: This request is not made for any commercial interest. As established in National Security Archive v. DOD, 880 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1989), journalists seeking information to disseminate to the public qualify for fee waivers when the disclosure is in the public interest.\r\n\r\nDissemination Ability: As an investigative journalist with I have demonstrated ability to disseminate information of public interest to a broad audience. Courts have consistently recognized that the news media serves a critical role in assisting the public in understanding government activities, as noted in Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Department of Defense, 241 F.Supp.2d 5, 11-12 (D.D.C. 2003).\r\nPublic Interest Value: Understanding how the Trump administration approaches social media content regulation across both terms (2017-2021 and 2025-present) is of significant public interest, as it directly impacts public discourse, access to information, and First Amendment rights. The D.C. Circuit in Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108, 1115-18 (D.C. Cir. 2015) specifically recognized that records that \"shed light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties\" qualify for fee waivers.\r\n\r\nEducational Value: These records will provide invaluable historical context and educational material about the evolution of government policies regarding digital speech platforms. As recognized in Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436 F. Supp. 2d 17, 26 (D.D.C. 2006), materials that advance public knowledge about government activities serve an educational purpose qualifying for fee waivers.\r\n\r\nImpact on Core Constitutional Values: The requested records directly relate to government actions potentially impacting First Amendment freedoms, which courts have recognized as warranting heightened public access. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (finding that government accountability, particularly regarding constitutional rights, strongly favors fee waivers).\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100, as required by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(e). Please also note that improper denial of fee waivers is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(vii).\r\n\r\nVI. FORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic formats with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nEmails: Please provide in .MSG or .EML format with complete headers, metadata, attachments, and BCC information.\r\n\r\nDocuments: Please provide in their original formats (e.g., .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX, .PDF) with all metadata.\r\nDatabases or Structured Data: Please provide in their original format or in .CSV or .XML format with data dictionaries.\r\n\r\nCommunication Records: For text messages, instant messages, or other electronic communications, please provide in a format that preserves threading, timestamps, and participant information.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records exists in electronic form, I request they be provided in electronic format. For any records that exist only in paper form, please provide high-resolution color scans (at least 300 dpi) in PDF format.\r\n\r\nVII. PRESERVATION REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records. This explicitly includes preserving all original metadata, and ensuring that automated email or document deletion systems do not destroy any potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nVIII. REQUEST FOR VAUGHN INDEX\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records are withheld or redacted, I request a detailed Vaughn index that:\r\n\r\nIdentifies each document withheld or redacted with specificity;\r\nStates the statutory exemption claimed;\r\n\r\nExplains how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption with specificity;\r\n\r\nProvides any segregable portions of the records; and\r\nExplains any discretionary release decisions.\r\n\r\nThe index should contain sufficient information for me to assess the applicability of any exemptions and the feasibility of a legal challenge to any withholdings.\r\n\r\nIX. REQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING AND SEARCH DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: DETAILED SEARCH DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED BY LAW\r\n\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), DOJ v. Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), and Oglesby v. Department of the Army, 920 F.2d 57 (D.C. Cir. 1990), I am entitled to detailed information about the search methodology used. Therefore, I hereby require the following specific documentation as part of the agency's response:\r\n\r\nThe tracking number assigned to this request;\r\nThe name of the FOIA officer(s) processing this request;\r\nA detailed description of the search methodology used to identify responsive records, including:\r\n\r\nComplete list of systems, databases, and repositories searched (ALL systems listed in Section II must be included, with specific justification for any omissions)\r\nSearch terms used for each system, including any variations, with exact spelling and syntax\r\nDate ranges searched for each system, with specific notation of any date limitations or exclusions\r\n\r\nPersonnel involved in the search, including their full names, titles, and responsibilities\r\n\r\nTime spent conducting searches by each individual, broken down by system searched\r\n\r\nAny search term limiters, modifiers, Boolean operators, or exclusions applied\r\n\r\nRecords of search queries run, including timestamps and results counts for each query\r\n\r\nDocumentation of any technical limitations encountered during searches\r\n\r\nRecords of any decisions to exclude certain systems from searching, with detailed justification\r\n\r\nComplete search logs from the FOIAXpress and Advanced Search Tool systems\r\n\r\nIf applicable, documentation of any de-duplication processes applied to search results, including parameters used and number of records removed\r\nCertification by the Information Management Officer that all potentially responsive systems were searched\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that courts have consistently held that agencies must demonstrate that searches were \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" (Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)) and that the agency cannot limit its search to \"one or more places if there are additional sources that are likely to turn up the information requested\" (Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\r\n\r\nUnder the \"reasonably calculated\" standard established in Founding Church of Scientology v. NSA, 610 F.2d 824 (D.C. Cir. 1979), failure to search each system listed in Section II or to document each search as specified above will be considered evidence of an inadequate search and will be cited as grounds for immediate appeal and potential litigation.\r\n\r\nX. RIGHT TO APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any adverse determination regarding this request, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nDenials of expedited processing\r\n\r\nDenials of fee waivers\r\n\r\nDeterminations regarding the adequacy of searches\r\nWithholdings or redactions based on FOIA exemptions\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that courts have consistently held that agencies must provide requesters with sufficient information to make informed decisions regarding potential litigation, including detailed justifications for any withholdings.\r\n\r\nXI. STATUTORY TIME LIMITS AND LITIGATION\r\n\r\nI expect a determination on this request within the statutory time limits specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i) (20 working days) and, if expedited processing is granted, within the accelerated timeframe specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I) (10 calendar days).\r\n\r\nI direct your attention to the following statutory and regulatory provisions governing FOIA compliance:\r\n\r\nConstructive Exhaustion: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), failure to comply with applicable time limits shall be deemed constructive exhaustion of administrative remedies, permitting immediate judicial review.\r\nLitigation Costs: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), a court may assess reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the complainant substantially prevails, which courts have interpreted to include cases where an agency improperly delays or obstructs FOIA processing.\r\n\r\nSpecial Counsel Referral: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F), when a court issues a written finding that agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to withholding records, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted.\r\n\r\nForeseeable Harm Standard: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i), an agency may withhold information only if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption, or if disclosure is prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nRule of Construction: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii), whenever full disclosure is not possible, the FOIA \"requires that any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\"\r\n\r\nYOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED that failure to comply with the statutory deadlines will result in immediate legal action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide a tracking number within 5 working days, as required by FOIA. If you have any questions or require clarification, please contact me rather than using delay tactics or issuing improper denials.\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",
