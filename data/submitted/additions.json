        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry into Iranian politician Sadeq Qotbzadeh, also spelled Sadegh Ghotbzadeh (24 February 1936 \u2013 15 September 1982), which were not released as part of request number 1484136-000. His death is widely-known and widely reported, and was even the subject of a February 2020 documentary by BBC Persian; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh immigrated to the United States in 1959, and attended Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service from 1959 to 1963. He participated in student protests against the Iranian government, and stormed a party held by Ardeshir Zadehi, then-Iranian ambassador in Washington. Soviet defector Vladimir Kuzichkin later claimed in his 1991 book, Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality, that Qotbzadeh had been an agent of Soviet military intelligence during this time.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh became a close aides to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and participated in the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was arrested in April 1982 on charges of plotting a coup d'etat, and was executed in September of that year.\r\n\r\nI previously requested records for Qotbzadeh, request number 1484136-000.\r\n\r\nIn your 29 January 2021 response to that request, you noted that \r\n\r\nAs I wrote in my initial 22 December 2020 request, \"If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\" However, your 29 January 2021 response letter states that you \"consider [the] request fulfilled\" after releasing documents from a previous search. As the letter continues, \"additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist,\" and I \"may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nI am requesting that additional search.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. \r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",
