Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices. Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a) mandates prompt availability of public agency records, especially where issues directly impact public welfare and accountability.\r\n\r\nJustification for Expedited Processing\r\nPublic Interest and Transparency: These records are crucial for public scrutiny of Medicaid spending, potential monopolistic practices, consumer choice limitations, and wage compliance within Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\n\r\nImmediate Impact on Vulnerable Populations: This request addresses policies that may limit autonomy, financial independence, and housing security for Medicaid beneficiaries, especially those with disabilities. Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices. Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
