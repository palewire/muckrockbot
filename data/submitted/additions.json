        "communication": "Dear Department of Commerce, Office of Security (OSY):\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to Buzz the Security Bee, OSY's \"security mascot\" for the U.S. Census Bureau's National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. According to the attached archived OYS website, Buzz was introduced in late 2006 and was developed to spread security awareness. The contact person on the website is Debra Rochner, so she may be one person to ask about responsive records (if she is still with the agency) or whose files or correspondence may have responsive records.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Buzz the Security Bee mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to OYS's decision to create a security mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Buzz-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books). Please include any related contracts or correspondence.\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Buzz costume that may have been created. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Buzz.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Buzz (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007, and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some around 2019.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using the Buzz mascot.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees.

Additionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein.
