However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",
