Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The CPS Cell Phone User Agreement; RESPONSE : Documents responsive to this portion of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n2. A listing of CPS Officials, including Board members, and employees who have signed a CPS Cell Phone User Agreement from July 1, 2023 to current. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed this portion of your request and determined that it fails to cite specific and/or existing records for review, and instead essentially seeks the answer to a question, outside the scope of the FOIA. Note that that the district does not maintain any comprehensive list of CPS officials that have signed CPS Cell Phone User Agreements from July 1, 2023 to current. In order to respond to this portion of your request, the district would be required to conduct original research in order to gather the requested information and then combine that information into a new record that is not maintained in the normal course of business in order to answer a question posed, and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 A FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989)]. Further, it has been determined that requesting a tally that a public body has not already prepared does not cite a public record for review as required under the FOIA and performing a review of records to prepare a tally constitutes preparing a new record, outside the scope of the FOIA. [Chi. Tribune Co. v. Dep't of Fin. & Prof'l Regulation, 2014 IL App (4th) 130427, 8 N.E.3d 11, 2014 Ill. App. LEXIS 120, 380 Ill. Dec. 80, 2014 WL 895023]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922). Section 1 of the FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\" In accordance with Section 1 of Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. \r\n3. A directory of CPS cell phone numbers.

The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

This should include any requests or responses to or from the New York Times itself, as well as responses to and from the Department of Homeland Security or related agency. This data that I am seeking is held by a mixture of agencies related to the Department of Homeland Security including but not limited to the Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine operations.\r\n \r\nThe New York Times report specified the existence of at least 270 hours of surveillance. I request copies of such surveillance recordings such as videos, photographs, radio or telephone interception information.\r\n\r\nI additionally request a detailed list of all cities which requested or were offered, or where operations were run relating to domestic demonstrations or protests, looting or rioting, or similarly related events.\r\n\r\nI am additionally writing to independently request contemporary FAA registration information such as agency name, addresses, ADS-B beacon information, Mode-S transponder identification, FAA tail numbers, as well as the make, model, year of production, and serial numbers for each aircraft. Aircraft should be understood to include helicopters, drones, airplanes, dirigibles, and any other vehicle - man or unmanned -  used for these operations or for operations which would, could, or did incidentally collect surveillance data on any activities in cities with protests or demonstrations during the months of May, 2020 and June, 2020. This includes but is not limited to operations above New York City (New York), Buffalo (New York), Minneapolis (Minnesota), Del Rio (Texas), Dayton (Ohio), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Washington (District of Columbia), Detroit (Michigan), Sierra Vista (Arizona), Corpus Christi (Texas), Portland (Oregon), Oakland (California), Los Angeles (California), and other minor or major American cities.\r\n\r\nFor each aircraft, I am requesting all maintenance records, vendor documents, emails, as well as other correspondence regarding or related to the aircraft within the last five years as well as any additional equipment attached to any of the aircraft used during the months of May 2020 and June 2020 relating to the demonstrations or related events. For example, if a Harris Corporation's cell site simulator is installed in the aircraft, even temporarily, I request information about this equipment, and its use during the specified time period. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am also seeking information about the Department of Homeland Security's \"Big Pipe\" program. I request all documents, emails, slides, training materials and other communications relating to the Big Pipe program. Furthermore, I request a list of which other federal agencies have access, access and audit logs about their use as well as the point person or contact information for the responsible person at their respective agency.\r\n\r\nThis information is part of a journalistic research project involving the Seattle Privacy Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

Note that the district does not maintain any comprehensive list of schools that the listed vendors have served. In order to respond to this portion of your request, the district would be required to conduct original research by reviewing records maintained by several departments in order to determine which schools were served and then combine that information into a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 A FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4th Dist. 1989)]. Further, it has been determined that requesting a tally that a public body has not already prepared does not cite a public record for review as required under the FOIA and performing a review of records to prepare a tally constitutes preparing a new record, outside the scope of the FOIA. [Chi. Tribune Co. v. Dep't of Fin. & Prof'l Regulation, 2014 IL App (4th) 130427, 8 N.E.3d 11, 2014 Ill. App. LEXIS 120, 380 Ill. Dec. 80, 2014 WL 895023]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922). Section 1 of the FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\" In accordance with Section 1 of Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. 2) Copies of all invoices from America Scores Chicago, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and SGA Youth and Family Services from the 2020-2021 fiscal year, 2021-2022 fiscal year and 2022-2023 fiscal year to date for each school which they serve. 3) Copies of records of payments by CPS/Chicago Board of Education to America Scores Chicago, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and SGA Youth and Family Services for the above noted time frames. I want the actual bills as well as proof of payment by the district or school, as the case may be. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to these portions of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Financial information, including EIN and bank account numbers of nonpublic entities, has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b), which exempts from release private information. Certain redactions have been made pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a) and the corresponding 105 ILCS 5/34-18.5(b) which prohibits the release of background check information. The assigned location of safe passage workers has been redacted pursuant to section 7(1)(v) which exempts from release, in pertinent part, \u201csecurity measures [including] details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(v). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a definitive contract (award ID: HQ003422C0094) awarded to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8). This contract has an action date of August 22, 2022, and is funded by the Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security for support services in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being done by AARO and its contractors. During an April 19, 2023 hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated AARO would need additional authorization from Congress to begin counterintelligence work, but given that Sancorp's contract with AARO started in 2022, prior to that hearing, and Sancorp lists on its website previous work in the field of counterintelligence, there is a possibility AARO may already be engaged in counterintelligence work without Congressional authorization. Sancorp's contract with AARO would help clarify this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of interfering with ongoing operations or disclosure of sensitive materials. Sancorp already lists the contract on their publicly-accessible website: https://www.sancorpconsulting.com/_files/ugd/7aeb19_0c37a59d213b4d68a043ef83b56edc9a.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Public Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"* I was unable to locate the Amtrak Police Department documents on its website. \r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by the Amtrak Police Department\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format.If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**:\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.The California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.I can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.Respectfully,Stanford University LibrariesRelevant links* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN\u00a7ionNum=13650* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#View request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Famtrak-police-department-19688%252Fsb-978-policiesurl-125308%252F%253Femail%253Dfoiarequests%252540amtrak.com&url_auth_token=AABtxl2F7AhilVfARqjDgIMWuWY%3A1nNJ3t%3ABRJuMSZ096VTWon--K0RtnhUGcsWXUKwgAASKTY_o2cIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:  JGLPVXUWAttachments:\u2022 Amtrak_Police_Department_of_the_United_States_of_America_Signed1Filed via MuckRock.comE-mail (Preferred): 125308-26319874@requests.muckrock.com.

A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) bearing tracking number SED MOU: 018-015 between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the City University of New York - Asian American/Asian Research Institute (AAARI/CUNY). This MOU was signed by Joyce Moy, Executive Director of AAARI at CUNY, on August 2, 2018, and was countersigned by Elizabeth R. Berlin, Executive Deputy Commissioner of NYSED, on July 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the amended MOU (Amendment #1) to the aforementioned MOU. This amended MOU was signed by Joyce Moy on February 13, 2020, and by Phyllis D. Morris, CFO of NYSED, on January 31, 2020.\r\n\r\n3. All communications, including but not limited to emails, letters, and memos, between the named signature parties (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris) related to the MOU and its amendment. Please note that email metadata, such as sender, recipient, date, and subject line, is considered responsive factual data and should be included in the disclosure, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\n4. All cash receipts, invoices, and payments received or disbursed related to the funds specified in the MOU and its amendment, as well as any related to the work product or completion of the MOU but borne by CUNY.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with third parties, subcontractors, or external entities to AAARI/CUNY related to the MOU and its amendment. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of any and all work product and interim work product viewed by outside parties, including NYSED, subcontractors, advisors, consultants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the advisory opinions FOIL-AO-19160, FOIL-AO-18321, and FOIL-AO-17725, even if the content of certain communications is exempt from disclosure under POL \u00a787(2)(g), the factual information about the communication itself, such as the sender, recipient, date, and subject line, should still be disclosed. This metadata does not typically contain deliberative or advisory content, but rather factual information about the communication itself. Therefore, I request that this factual information be disclosed in response to my FOIL request, even if the content of the communications is exempt.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight the urgency of this request in light of the ongoing legislative discussions around Senate Bill S1402, which seeks to amend education law in relation to culturally responsive education and curriculum. The records requested are directly relevant to the public understanding of the state's efforts in this area, particularly the work of NYSED and AAARI/CUNY under the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to remind you of the retention requirements under the New York State Archives' LGS-1 schedule. Records that are subject to a FOIL request must be retained until the request has been fully resolved, including any potential appeal process.\r\n\r\nIf any record has been denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the law. I expect the request to be filled within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGiven the relevance of these records to ongoing legislative discussions and public interest, I kindly request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance with this matter.\r\n\r\nNB: You can find reference to the MOU and Amendment Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_VK1ACtp.pdf and Here https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2023/05/31/CUNY_MOU_Amended_4VCegX6.pdf respectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

I am writing in response to your letter dated June 14, 2023, acknowledging the receipt of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, and the subsequent extension letter dated July 13, 2023.\r\n\r\nI understand that the City University of New York (CUNY) University Central Office is currently conducting a diligent search for the requested records. I appreciate your efforts in this regard and acknowledge the complexity of the task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential for delays in the process. To mitigate this, I kindly request a rolling release of documents as they are found and reviewed. This would allow me to begin reviewing the information that is readily available while you continue your search for the remaining records.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request for more specific parameters for items #3 and #5, I propose the following:\r\n\r\nFor item #3, let's limit the time period to August 1, 2018, through February 29, 2021, which covers the signing of the original MOU and its amendment. The search terms could include the names of the signatories (Joyce Moy, Elizabeth R. Berlin, and Phyllis D. Morris), \"MOU\", \"Amendment\", \"SED MOU: 018-015\", and \"NYSED\".\r\n\r\nFor item #5, the same time period and search terms could apply. As for specific individuals from AAARI/CUNY, I would suggest starting with Joyce Moy, as she signed both the MOU and its amendment.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you acknowledge receipt of this response promptly and provide an updated timeline for when I can expect to receive the first batch of documents. I understand that these processes can take time, and I appreciate your commitment to ensuring a thorough review of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",

The officer asked for a specific time period, search terms, and specific individuals from \"AAARI/CUNY\" by COB June 28, 2023, or else CUNY University Central Office would deny requests #3 and #5 as overly broad.\r\n\r\nI believe this response constitutes an arbitrary denial of access and a willful attempt to avoid responding to my request. The deadline of June 28, 2023, appears to be an attempt to limit the scope of my request without conducting a detailed search, which is contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nMy original request, I believe, was reasonably described and in compliance with the FOIL. Furthermore, I have recently responded to the Records Access Officer's request for more specific parameters in a manner that is accommodating and within the bounds of reasonableness.\r\n\r\nI am appealing this decision on the grounds that it is a violation of the Freedom of Information Law, specifically Public Officers Law, Article 6, which guarantees the public's right to access government records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that this appeal be reviewed promptly, and that the decision to impose an arbitrary deadline be reconsidered. I am also forwarding a copy of this appeal to the Committee on Open Government for their review.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Original Request (June 7, 2023): Submitted as per the details outlined above.\r\n2. Acknowledgment and Request to Split (June 14, 2023): Agency acknowledged the request and asked for additional information for requests #3 and #5. The request to split was accepted, and additional information was provided.\r\n3. Administrative Closure and New Request (July 13, 2023): Requests #3 and #5 were administratively closed, and a new FOIL request was treated for those categories.\r\n4. Appeal (July 17, 2023): An appeal was filed, arguing against arbitrary denial of access.\r\n5. Response to Appeal (August 7, 2023): Appeal was denied, and the response provided detailed reasoning.\r\n6. Extension Letter (August 16, 2023): Extension until September 18, 2023, was notified.\r\n\r\nStatutory Timelines:\r\n- Response Deadline: The current response deadline is set for September 18, 2023.\r\n- Appeal Timeline: The appeal was filed and responded to within the statutory timelines.\r\n\r\nRequested Exemptions and Justifications:\r\n- Exemption for Delay: Justification provided was the need for additional time to review records for applicable exemptions, legal privileges, and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nCounterpoints to Exemptions:\r\n- Exemption for Delay:\r\n  - Counterpoint: While we understand the need for a thorough review, the extension should be reasonable and in line with the public's right to timely access. The specific reasons for the delay should be clearly articulated, and continuous updates should be provided.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the agency adhere to the statutory timelines and provide a prompt and comprehensive response to the FOIL request. Should there be any further delays, exemptions, or denials, I request clear and detailed justifications in accordance with the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll records within the jurisdiction of the NASA related to, within the time frame of 2008 to 2019, with respect to this criteria and article referenced:\r\n\r\nTo preface, see this article: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-takes-a-cue-from-silicon-valley-to-hatch-artificial-intelligence-technologies\r\n\r\n1. Records/documents that describe and detail the machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms applied by NASA in reference to WASP-12b, an exoplanet discovered in 2008. Authors are included in the article which likely communicated with NASA, as well as NASA's Frontier Development Lab (FDL) itself. Which is mentioned explicitly are: Bayesian neural networks and Random Forests.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore, I request the code and program specifications with these machine learning algorithms and potentially others were employed by NASA in their endeavors to analyze the dataset, based on NASA's Hubble Telescope, involving the atmosphere of WASP-12b among possibly other features of the exoplanet. I request the code be in its original unaltered form and its original programming language excluding the dataset itself. However, I request to know the features relevant in the analysis of WASP-12b.\r\n\r\n3. To quote the article, \"While the technique developed by this team is still in development, other FDL technologies have already been adopted in the real world. By 2017, FDL participants developed a machine learning program that could quickly create 3D models of nearby asteroids, accurately estimating their shapes, sizes, and spin rates. This information is critical to NASA\u2019s efforts to detect and deflect threatening asteroids from Earth.\" - Therefore, I wish to know the same as (1) and (2) but within the context of the machine learning program mentioned in the creation of 3D asteroids, while estimating their shapes, sizes, and spine rates as specified in the article.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I request all records containing the term \"Trump Organization\" that the FBI did not consider to be of investigative interest.  I believe that these records can most easily be located by conducting a full-text ECF search and a CRS main file and cross-reference search, eliminating the records resulting from the CRS main file and cross-reference searches, and producing the remaining records.  If it is easier, you may break my request into two parts: one for ECF and one for CRS, search for \"Trump Organization\" regardless of whether the records was of investigative interest, and produce the records separately and I will make the comparison myself.   If my request is unclear or I can assist in the process, please contact me by email at matt@loevy.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specifically, I am looking for any discussion inside the Justice Department in which Mr. Barr mentioned his dissatisfaction with the length of the prison sentence that Justice Department prosecutors recommended for Mr. Stone, and his disagreements with others inside the Justice Department who believed the prosecutors' recommended length of the prison sentence was justified.\r\n\r\nRoger Stone is a former political consultant and former adviser to President Donald Trump who has worked for the campaigns of several Republican presidential candidates, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, and Donald Trump. In January 2019, Mr. Stone was arrested and charged with \"one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering,\" according to the following article in Bloomberg News:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/roger-stone-arrested-in-florida-as-part-of-special-counsel-probe\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request any and all internal directives or policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) regarding EOIR\u2019s process for contracting out, obtaining, and reviewing transcripts of hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ) for review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), as required by the BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.2(f). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request any current internal directives, manuals, memos, policy guidance, or other documents related to:  \r\n1.\tProcesses and procedures for assigning Digital Audio Recording(s) (\u201cDAR\u201d) to transcription contractors, including but not limited to Free State Reporting, Inc. (\u201cFree State\u201d), to be transcribed for purposes of creating the Record of Proceeding(s) (\u201cROP\u201d) for review by the BIA (see attached document for previous guidance, last updated in 2015)\r\n2.\tAny training, education, or certification EOIR requires of transcribers or the transcription companies with which EOIR contracts;\r\n3.\tAny policies and guidance regarding EOIR oversight and quality control over the transcription process, including any quality control checklists used by EOIR staff; \r\n4.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR takes when the transcription contractor sends back a defective or otherwise unsatisfactory transcript, for example one with significant typos, indiscernible notations, or other errors, including any processes for returning a defective or unsatisfactory transcript to the transcription contractor to be re-transcribed;\r\n5.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR and/or the transcription contractor takes when the DAR is partially or totally inaudible such that it cannot be properly transcribed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that EOIR waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding how and when immigration proceedings are transcribed for appellate purposes. CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations\u2014representing non-citizens before EOIR.  As a provider of legal services to non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients.\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is currently briefing a Petition for Review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which defects in the transcript present a central issue on appeal. Information about the transcription process will help CAIR Coalition articulate legal arguments about our client's due process right to meaningful appellate review and advocate for broadly applicable law and procedures to be employed when a defective transcript is hindering review. Petitioner's opening brief to the Fourth Circuit is due on June 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

The FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard. The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances. Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. Please be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. EOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities. Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records. Your request has been placed in track three for complex requests. If you have filed an application for a fee waiver, EOIR will address your request in a separate letter. Additionally, if you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. If you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request.

In it, the office stated \"The Department of Defense's (DoD) Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) will conduct a Solutions Meeting to support efforts to enhance the defense and protection of critical weapon systems. The Solutions Meeting will take place in Summer 2019 in McLean, VA. The Meeting provides selected innovative companies with an opportunity to make short technical presentations to government representatives about their technologies and products. There is a potential for companies to be selected for pilot projects or experimentation if their technology appears to match the DoD's needs.\" \r\n\r\nI am requesting a copy of all companies that submitted an application for the Solutions Meeting. In particular, the DOD stated \"Companies interested in participating in the Solutions Meeting should submit an application to RRTO Innovation via e-mail to osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.rrto-innovation@mail.mil. \" In particular, there should be emails with the Email subject line \u201cJAIC Solutions Meeting Application\u201d per DoD's instructions. \r\n\r\nI am seeking the full emails of all vendors who sent a proposal between April 1st 2019 and August 1st, 2019.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFreddy Martinez\n\n",

        "communication": "Mr. Martinez,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is why we provided you with the option to use their website to contact them, as they would work with you on the information that you need and help you get what you are looking for at a much faster process then going through the FOIA.  This way you will be able to get information directly from them with the parameters that you are looking for.  This going back and forth trying to figure out a way to narrow your scope and get you the info you want seems to me could be done a lot faster if you were dealing directly with them.  They have provided that avenue and we have forwarded that to you in a previous email.  If you would try that and see if this gets you the info you want I think you will find it is much easier and faster.   Then you can let us know if it satisfies your request and if it does we can close it out on this end.  I hope this makes since and Laura can re-send you the website info again if need be.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStephen L.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I have been producing, on behalf of the District, public records request logs, which are \u201celectronic cop[ies]\u201d of \u201cPublic Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d I understood the logs to be directly responsive to the first part of your request.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  If you do not believe public records request logs are responsive to your request, please clarify your request to explain what records you intended to request by seeking \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d\r\n  2.  As you likely know, Washington law does not require agencies to retain records relating to public requests records beyond two years after the request is closed. The Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule, section 5.4, sets forth records that may be destroyed after two years, which \u201c[i]ncludes but is not limited to:\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInternal and external correspondence relating to the request;\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records provided to the requestor (copies or lists of the records provided, etc.);\u201d and\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records (or portions) withheld (exemption logs, copies of portions redacted, etc.).\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, many such records relating to requests closed more than 2 years prior to the date of your request no longer exist. That is also why I was producing request logs to you. For many of the older requests, the request logs may be the only existing records. Do you no longer want to receive request logs, even if they may be the only existing records potentially responsive to your request with respect to requests closed more than two years prior to the date of your request?\r\n\r\n  1.  I was also producing request logs to give you an opportunity to identify particular requests that were of interest to you, so searches for records relating to those requests could be prioritized. Is that an opportunity that is of interest to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before August 12. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s next response. The District will not proceed with the next installment scheduled for July 20, pending receipt of your answers, so that the District\u2019s responses can reflect an accurate understanding of what you are requesting. If you do not answer within 30 days, your request may be closed.\r\n\r\nThe District is under no obligation to produce records to you in a reverse chronological order. Records will be produced in a manner that reflects the most efficient method of assembling and reviewing potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Therefore, appended hereto please find:\r\n\r\n2019 Log\r\n\r\nThis record contains information that is exempt under the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56.RCW. Redactions made pursuant to the Act are marked with an overlying code. I have also attached a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that provides an explanation of the basis for the exemptions applied. If no code is applied or if a code is partially visible, the applicable codes are 1A, 10A.\r\n\r\nI regret that it was not possible to make an installment of records to you on the previously estimated date of August 3, 2022. The factors affecting the extension of that date included staff absences due to illness and vacation break, and ongoing workload in this department.\r\nAs I indicated to you in response to your request PRR 11022021-Anon, the District is not withholding any records from you and has nothing to hide.\r\nPlease direct all messages pertaining to your request to the public records mailbox, publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nThe automated correspondence features of the Muckrock site are not an efficient way to correspond or to review correspondence. Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string, or by excerpting them in any way. I know that the correspondence history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that a complete and accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nI estimate a next installment to your request will be made on or before September 26, 2022. Estimated dates are subject to change. The timing of this estimate is based on anticipated staff absences, operational responsibilities related to school reopening, and the workload in this department.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.
