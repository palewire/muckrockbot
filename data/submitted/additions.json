        "communication": "This is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records related to Dr. John Frederick Prados (born 9 January 1951, New York City, USA \u2013 died 29 November 2022). Dr. Prados was an independent scholar, author, and fellow at the nonprofit National Security Archive. One focus of\u00a0his\u00a0work was the Central Intelligence Agency, on which he had written\u00a0books and many papers. These included The Ghosts of Langley: Into the CIA\u2019s Heart of Darkness; The Family Jewels: The CIA, Secrecy, and Presidential Power; and What the CIA Tells Congress (Or Doesn\u2019t) about Covert Operations: The Barr/Cheney/Bush Turning Point for CIA Notifications to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your standard search protocol, please also conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the National Security Archive and on the SI-TK-BYEMAN group for additional records related to Dr. Prados.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS:\r\n\r\n1. The subject concerns the operations or activities of the US Government. My request satisfies this factor because it requests records related to the operations or activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the US Government.\r\n\r\n2-3. The disclosure is informative (i.e. \"likely to contribute\") to the public's understanding of the US Government. My request satisfies this factor because the subject of the request, Dr. John Prados, was an independent scholar of declassified CIA documents and an author of many books and papers about the CIA. Thus, any responsive records will allow the public to understand what kinds of records the US Government keeps on people who research its activities, particularly its national intelligence activities. Moreover, Dr. Prados was a public figure. News obituaries about him appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post, among other places. Thus, responsive records about Dr. Prados are likely to be of interest to a broad and significant segment of the public, as opposed to the narrow personal interest of the requester. \r\n\r\n4. The disclosure is likely to contribute to the public's understanding significantly, because Dr. Prados has recently died. Therefore, the Agency will likely to be able to disclose significantly more records to the public than could have been released while Dr. Prados was alive, due to privacy restrictions in the FOIA and Privacy Act statutes. Moreover, I am making this request via MuckRock.com, meaning that anyone in the world will be able to view all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\nNO COMMERCIAL INTEREST\r\n\r\n1. I have no commercial interest in these records. I am seeking them because Dr. Prados was a master at uncovering government secrets. I can think of no greater tribute to him than to request the records that were kept on him by the very agency whose declassified documents occupied so much of his time.\r\n\r\n2. I have no commercial interest in these records. Therefore that (nonexistent) commercial interest does not outweigh the public interest.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Agency should grant a full fee waiver. If you disagree and decide to charge me fees, please inform me of the total charges before fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically,  by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention to this request, and I await your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
