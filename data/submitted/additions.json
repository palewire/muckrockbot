During this time, Ms. Hawes worked for Polsinelli PC, Amstrong Teasdale and The Hawes Law Firm. We are seeking any correspondence that she may have had with SLDC during this time period, where she was active in working on local real estate matters. This includes, but is not limited to, any emails she had with SLDC relating to her work related to federal Opportunity Zones.\r\n\r\nWe are also asking a copy of any conflict of interest paperwork that Ms. Hawes would have filed as part of joining SLDC's board.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGlenn Burleigh",
