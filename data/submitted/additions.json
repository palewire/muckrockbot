Facility assessments for York High School;\r\n2. Facility assessments for Jefferson High School;\r\n\r\nPlease provide the most recent facilities assessment available. Chicago Public Schools directed me to Cook County for these facility assessments. CPS is required to complete a comprehensive biennial condition assessment of each facility owned, leased, or operated by the district.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani",
