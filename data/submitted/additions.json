        "communication": "Dear National Park Service:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to NPS mascot Sunny Saguaro, the mascot of Saguaro National Park.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Sunny Saguaro mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to NPS's decision to create a mascot for Saguaro National Park in the first place. Community engagement coordinator Cam Ju\u00e1rez may have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Sunny Saguaro-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Sunny Saguaro costumes. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Sunny Saguaro.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all photographs of Sunny Saguaro.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all correspondence related to Sunny Saguaro (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some mascot-related correspondence around 2019.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using Sunny Saguaro as part of NPS's public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
