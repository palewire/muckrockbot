From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We are not the records custodian for that office, and will only have responsive records to the extent that such records were sent to or from the Office of the Governor.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to the extent we have responsive records, we will endeavor to respond to your request. I have broken out our responses/requests for clarification below, corresponding to the separate items in your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nWe do not have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. First, there are no search terms or keywords identified for this request. Second, the request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" Interpreted literally and applied to the Office of the Governor, this would essentially cover every email sent to or from our office to any state employee, regardless of subject or keywords. This is likely to return thousands of documents and incur significant costs. Please confirm whether this is the intended scope of your request.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. Similar to part (2), this request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" With the inclusion of the specified keywords, there are likely to be somewhat fewer responsive documents, but I am not sure whether this is the intended scope.\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo the extent that this request was intended to cover only communications between employees of or persons associated with the University of Georgia, on the one hand, and the Office of the Governor, on the other, the responsive records would be identical to those provided to you on May 8th (attached).\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\nThere is no request following \"4\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like us to interpret this request, and if you wish, provide any additional clarification to your request.

Please do not reply to this e-mail. ***\r\nThank you for submitting your open records request under the Public Information Act (PIA) to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Your request has been forwarded to the PUC\u2019s Public Information Coordinator. The Public Information Coordinator will address PIA requests in the order they are received, but in all cases within the time prescribed by law.\r\nTime To Respond\r\nWe will promptly respond to your request by providing the requested information, informing you there is no responsive information, or notifying you all or a portion of the requested information falls under an exception to public disclosure and requires a ruling from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG). If the requested information does not fall under an exception to public disclosure but will take longer than 10 business days to produce, we will notify you of the date and time the information will be provided.\r\nRequest for Clarification\r\nYou can help us respond more quickly to your request by ensuring that your request is clear, specific, and requests only the information you wish to receive. We do our best to relate requests to the information we have and do not require records to be requested by their specific names, but if you know the specific name of the record you are requesting, it will help us respond more efficiently.\r\nIf your request is vague or overly broad, we may, in compliance with Texas Government Code \u00a7 552.222, request clarification in order to ensure we understand what information you are requesting.  Also, please keep in mind that we are not required under the PIA to create new information, do legal research, or answer questions.  See Open Records Decision Nos. 555 and 563 at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/open-records-decisions.\r\nWithholding Information\r\nAlthough the PIA makes most government information available to the public, some exceptions exist. If we believe an exception applies, we will notify you that the information cannot be released and request a ruling from the OAG.\r\nCosts\r\nYou may be charged for costs associated with responding to your request.  Personnel time is charged at $15 per hour, plus 20% of the personnel charge for overhead. There is also a charge of $0.10 per page, plus personnel time, if the request exceeds fifty pages, plus postage. These rates are set by the OAG.  You can find more information regarding costs associated with PIA requests here: https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=4&ti=1&pt=3&ch=70&rl=Y.\r\nFor more information regarding access to public information held by the PUC, please visit our website at https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/contact/PIA.aspx.\r\n\r\nYou may also find more detailed information regarding the PIA in Texas Government Code Chapter 552 or on the OAG\u2019s website at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/members-public.\n",

The request does not duplicate a major category of records, and does not seek \"all records containing particular words\" or \"every report filed with the public office for a particular time period\". My request asked for only specific reports during a specific time span, and only for records that were pertaining to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nSince you disagreed as to the narrowness of that request, allow me to modify the request to be even more specific and provide additional information to help you ascertain which records are responsive:\r\n\r\nA copy of any PDF, Word Document, InDesign Document, and/or email, received by COTA's Office of the President, which was originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard, received in the years 2020 or 2021, containing or about a particular report, hereinafter referred to as \"the report\". The report is the final report in a study which was commissioned by COTA, which explored various ways to fund the portion of COTA's budget which is currently sourced from passenger fares, in the event that COTA decided to make passenger fares free. The report was commissioned about three years ago (2018-2020) and completed about a year later (2020-2021). The study and report were paid for in part using COTA funds. The report may be referred to as \"the Ice Miller report\" in casual usage. I am interested in the final report document, in whatever format it was provided in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know whether you require additional detail to identify this report.",

        "communication": "Hi Nicole,\r\n\r\nI disagree with your characterization of my request as \"ambiguous and overly broad\" as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"all records containing particular words\" - This request is for a specific report with an identified subject matter, not \"all records\" containing particular words.  \r\n2. \"duplication for all records having to do with a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report pertaining to a particular topic, not all records pertaining to that topic.  \r\n3. \"all records of a particular type\" - This request is for a specific report in whatever format it may be in, not all records of a particular type or format.  \r\n4. \"all emails sent or received by a particular email address with no subject matter or time limitation\" - This request is for a specific report. In the event that that report may have been transmitted by email, the email is identified with subject matter and time limitations.  \r\n5. \"all documents which document any and all instances of a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report, with certain identifying characteristics noted in the request. This is not a request for all documents which discuss this report's topic.  \r\n6. \"discovery-style requests that seek all records relating to or reflecting certain types of information\" - This request is limited by date range, the name of the report's author, the report's subject matter, and the type of document containing the report. This is a request for a specific report. It is not a discovery-style request.   \r\n\r\nBelow, I have rephrased my request in order to make it clearer which records I am requesting. I have also included additional information about the requested record, which further narrows the scope of the request.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of a report in COTA's possession. The report has all of the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Prepared by Ice Miller or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n2. Originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n3. Received by COTA in December 2022 or in January 2021\r\n4. Titled \"Fare-Free Transit Analysis\" or with similar words\r\n5. With a subject matter of free public transportation or fare-free transit\r\n6. Commissioned by COTA, and paid for in some part using COTA funds\r\n\r\nThe following details are provided to help you in your search, but the requested document may not meet all or any of these characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. The report may have been attached to an email from Michael.Coleman@icemiller.com or from an @icemiller.com email address\r\n2. The email or report may be dated December 4, 2020, or later\r\n3. The email or report may mention Robert Miller, a past COTA Board member\r\n4. The report may have been included in an email sent to Joanna Pinkerton, to PinkertonJM@cota.com, to another COTA employee in the COTA Office of the President at that time, to Terry Foegler, and/or to Sophia Mohr\r\n\r\nIn the event that multiple versions of the report are discovered, I request the final version of the report. In the event that the report is available in multiple formats, I request the digital version of the PDF, Word Document, or other original document(s) sent to COTA. In the event that the report is split across multiple files or documents (such as a cover letter, a slide deck, and appendices), I request those documents which are necessary to compile the complete report. In the event that the report was submitted by electronic mail to COTA, I also request a copy of the email that was used to send the files comprising the report, in addition to the report files themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this information is still insufficient to identify the responsive records, then pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(2) I request a copy of COTA's document retention schedule, and information on the manner in which records are retained by COTA and its Office of the President and accessed in the ordinary course of the office's duties.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Keith",

December 2020 is 2 years and 1 month ago. Two years is less than 7 years. The responsive email should be retained under COTA's document retention policy.\r\n\r\nSince you have successfully located the report, which was sent by email, you must have identified and located the email that contained the report. Send me a copy of that email.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBen Keith",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDocuments pertaining to DOCCS policy or documentation about inter-prison transfers of incarcerated people (see below for a note about what is meant by \u201cinter-prison transfers,\u201d in case the term is unclear or does not align with DOCCS terminology). Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n\r\n1) All policies, procedures, memorandums of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, any other sort of agreement, and all related directive materials regarding the transfer of incarcerated persons between different facilities within New York state. \r\n\r\n2) From 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2021 specifically: all documents, papers, letters, email correspondence, memoranda, training materials, presentations, directives, guidance, press releases, or other communications (both internal and external) about transfers and COVID-19. This includes \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss transfer procedures and mention COVID-19, health precautions, and/or respiratory illness. It also includes (but is not limited to) any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss changes to the frequency of transfers in response to the virus (e.g., halting transfers, minimizing transfers, transferring at-risk incarcerated people, etc.). \r\n\r\n3) Any contracts or agreements regarding inter-prison transfers, including but not limited to a contract with a private transfer company, vehicle purchasing or leasing, and so on.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON DEFINITION: By inter-prison transfer, I am referring to any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility,\u201d as recorded in DOCCS\u2019s \u201cIncarcerated Lookup\u201d database. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. If the records provided refer to movements more broadly than this definition of transfers, that is acceptable and please send them. However, if there are records that refer ONLY to types of movements that would not include inter-prison transfers as defined here, they fall outside of this request.

Specifically, I am requesting:1) All policies, procedures, memorandums of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, any other sort of agreement, and all related directive materials regarding the transfer of incarcerated persons between different facilities within New York state.2) From 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2021 specifically: all documents, papers, letters, email correspondence, memoranda, training materials, presentations, directives, guidance, press releases, or other communications (both internal and external) about transfers and COVID-19. This includes \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss transfer procedures and mention COVID-19, health precautions, and/or respiratory illness. It also includes (but is not limited to) any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss changes to the frequency of transfers in response to the virus (e.g., halting transfers, minimizing transfers, transferring at-risk incarcerated people, etc.).3) Any contracts or agreements regarding inter-prison transfers, including but not limited to a contract with a private transfer company, vehicle purchasing or leasing, and so on.NOTE ON DEFINITION: By inter-prison transfer, I am referring to any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility,\u201d as recorded in DOCCS\u2019s \u201cIncarcerated Lookup\u201d database. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. If the records provided refer to movements more broadly than this definition of transfers, that is acceptable and please send them. However, if there are records that refer ONLY to types of movements that would not include inter-prison transfers as defined here, they fall outside of this request. If there is any question about this, please feel free to reach out and I am happy to clarify.The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your reply objects to the City's denial of access pursuant to OPRA's security exemption and based upon protecting the citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy who attended the Teaneck demonstration held on March 10, 2024.  The City evaluated its prior response in light of your reply, and its position remains that you are not legally entitled to access the requested materials.  In addition to the reasons set forth in the City's March 14, 2024 response, an additional reason that the requested materials are exempt from public access is that the underlying footage constitutes law enforcement records relating to citizens who were neither arrested nor charged.  See Fuster v. Twp. of Chatham, 477 N.J. Super. 477 (App. Div. 2023) (determining that government records involving a person who has not been arrested or charged with an offense are entitled to confidentiality based upon long-established judicial precedent).  As such, the City is legally precluded from releasing any footage of citizens generated during the March 10th demonstration.  We trust that this correspondence satisfies your concerns, and we again note that the City is closing out your OPRA request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nApoorvaa Mandar Bichu",

Portions of the records have been redacted pursuant to rule 10.500(e)(1)(C), (f)(3).)\r\n\r\nThe file sizes exceed the limits of our e-mail server; therefore, we are providing you the records using a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the requested records, open your web browser and follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n1.     Go to https://ftp.jud.ca.gov<https://ftp.jud.ca.gov/> and the login box for the SFTP site will appear.\r\n2.     Type in the user name: pajarguest.\r\n3.

Select the location where you want to save each file and click OK.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, the instructions are almost the same.  The only difference would be that, in the fifth step, you would open files from a pop-up box on the screen.  If you have difficulties, you may need to hit refresh, check your network settings, or check your firewall settings. The documents will be available for download from the SFTP site for approximately 7 to 10 days.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the SFTP site will lock you out if the system detects any of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n  *   your computer or device is seeking to connect from a malicious or unsafe server;\r\n  *   your computer or device contains potentially infected software;\r\n  *   you have made too many login attempts in a short interval; or\r\n  *   you made too many unsuccessful login attempts in a short interval.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we cannot offer specific technical assistance if you have difficulty using the SFTP site.  If this occurs, we can make alternative arrangements to provide the responsive records such as by mailing a flash drive or hard copies, or by arranging an in-person inspection.  You would be responsible for the costs of any copying, shipping, handling, or materials in such circumstances.  (Cal.

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Be advised that private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; that data has been withheld, including Federal Tax Identification Number and other bank information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(g), \u201cTrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm on the person or business, and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested.\u201d Additionally, records have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(m): Communications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. Furthermore, 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f) exempts any \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations,\u00a0memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d Lastly, identifiable student information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) in accordance with Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Public access Counselor, Office of the Attorney General, 500 South 2 nd Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62706, FAX: 217-782-1396, E-mail: publicaccess@atg.state.il.us .

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease note that certain private information (signatures and personal addresses) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Please note that all other records are being withheld entirely pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f) at this time as factual information inextricably intertwined in ongoing investigation and processes as well as 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(n), which exempts from release records relating to the adjudication of employee discipline and grievance matters except for records reflecting the final outcome. \r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(d)(ii) records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings conducted by the public body that is the recipient of the request. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

Schmaderer \r\nChief of Police \r\n \r\n Omaha Police Department \r\n \u201cTo Serve and Protect\u201d \r\n 505 South 15th Street \r\n Omaha, Nebraska 68102-2769 \r\n (402) 444-5600 \r\n (402) 444-5898 \r\n police.cityofomaha.org (mailto:police.cityofomaha.org) Dear Adam, On behalf of Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer, I am responding to your request for Omaha Police Department records.\u00a0 Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act.\u00a0 In your request dated June 30 2022, you sought\u00a0 the following information: \u00a01) A copy of the full settings for the Facebook page, including records relating to the \"Page Visibility,\" \"Country Restrictions,\" \"Age Restrictions,\" \"Content Moderation,\" and \"Profanity filter\" settings, 2) A copy of the list of banned people and pages; 3) A copy of the list of \"Page Roles\"; 4) A copy of the lists of users blocked by the Twitter account; 5) Any policy concerning public use of or interaction with the Facebook and Twitter accounts.\u00a0 This is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712(4). The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute do not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. Your request is denied in part and approved in part. Your request for the various administrative social media settings Facebook and Twitter, and the content within them is denied.\u00a0 Even though the social media sites are open to the public for viewing and posting of comments, the information you are requesting is not for public dissemination pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. The Public Information Office (PIO) manages the Omaha Police Department's social media sites.\u00a0 I have been told they do have a list of approximately 200 individuals blocked and banned from the early onset of our use of social media.\u00a0 I am told that no one has been blocked or banned from our social media sites in several years.\u00a0 We value the foundation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and as such we do not encourage blocking or banning citizens from our social media sites. Your request for the list of banned and blocked people and pages is denied, as this information is not for public dissemination pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. As previously mentioned, the PIO manages the Omaha Police Department's social media sites.\u00a0 Your request for a copy of the 'Page Role' is denied pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. Your request for the policy concerning use or interaction within Facebook and Twitter can be found by clicking on the following link: https://public.powerdms.com/OPDEP1/tree/documents/2347571 Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is the sole entity responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience with this request.\u00a0 If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.6089. Sincerely, Anna",

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

Accordingly, families hold a substantive due process right under the 14th Amendment and that information should be redacted to protect their privacy interests.

\r\n\r\n--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n Public Records Request: P003584-042124 \r\n \r\n   \r\n  \r\n RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of April 21, 2024 Reference # P003584-042124 Dear Requester, I am writing in response to your public records request of April 21, 2024, in which you requested the following: Any records relating to reports and complaints filled by researchers (students and faculty) about concern to animal health and safety across the University of Wisconsin schools including the School of Medicine and Public Health, the School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences from January, 1, 2023- present day. Access the Public Records Center to download the responsive records.  Under the Wisconsin Public Records Laws, records custodians must carefully weigh the competing public interests involved when deciding to release any record in their possession.\u00a0 Custodians begin with a presumption of complete public access to such records.\u00a0 However, custodians must consider whether inspection of the record could result in harm to the public interest that would outweigh the benefits of such inspection.\u00a0 When such harm substantially outweighs the benefits of public inspection, such records, or portions thereof, must remain confidential. Additional information has been provided with this request to inform the requestor of steps taken to address complaints included in this reply. Material not related to the steps taken in response to these complaints has been removed from the meeting minutes provided. This is not a redaction of records. The additional records provided are not responsive to the request; they are merely something the university has chosen to provide for additional information. Personally identifiable information of individuals engaged in or supporting animal research: Pursuant to an application of the balancing test inherent in Wisconsin\u2019s public records law, we have made the specific determination that the public interest in safeguarding and preventing the harassment of individuals involved in animal research outweighs the public interest in compelled disclosure of their personally identifying information. Furthermore, by applying the balancing test inherent in the public records law, we have determined that the public policy interest in maintaining the university\u2019s competitive position outweighs the interest in disclosing the personally identifiable information of our employees, students, collaborators, and other supporters of animal research. This determination aligns with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(e), permitting the closure of publicly held meetings for competitive reasons. We\u2019ve specifically determined that disclosing personally identifiable information about individuals engaged in or supporting animal research would jeopardize the university's competitive standing (Cf. Wis. Stat. \u00a719.35(1)(a), incorporating public policy expressed in \u00a719.85(1)(e).). For instance, revealing such information could lead to threats or harassment, potentially prompting talented staff or students to seek employment or educational opportunities elsewhere. Additionally, it could strain vital research partnerships. The departure of skilled personnel or students would diminish the university's standing compared to its competitors, hindering its ability to serve the State effectively. The considerable public interest in the ongoing social and economic benefits stemming from university research outweighs any marginal interest in the specific names contained in these records. We have also considered that any public interest in these records is fully satisfied by the substantial information being released, and not harmed by redactions to the identity of specific persons. References to animal research locations (locations and housing) and full denial of a video: Applying the public records law balancing test, we determined that the public interest in protecting university research facilities, activities, and personnel from criminal interference, disorderly conduct, vandalism and other disruption of lawful research and academic activities outweighs the public interest in knowing the exact locations of research animals and facilities. Specific locations have been denied and in the case of one complaint that included a video, the video is denied in total. There is no means to redact the video to a point where it could be unidentifiable of location. The complaint itself is provided redacted for identifiable information only. This determination is supported by Wis. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 16.851 and 19.36(9), which shield plans and specifications of state-owned and state-leased buildings from disclosure, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding such information. Additionally, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d) permits the closure of meetings to discuss crime prevention strategies, highlighting the public policy favoring nondisclosure in the interest of preventing criminal activities. The university is required to inform you that to the extent this amounts to a denial of your request it is subject to review by mandamus under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(a) or by application to the attorney general or district attorney pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(b). The university has responded to your request and it is now closed. Sincerely, Julie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request",

Bronfman Sr.; it also states that some records were destroyed. \r\n\r\nThe pages and quick turnaround are appreciated. However, I wish to implore the Bureau to continue searching for records and respond accordingly. Please take note of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n1) My own request included an explicit request for \"destruction or transfer slips\" in the case records were destroyed or transferred to NARA; this was not fulfilled in the prior FOIPA response.\r\n\r\n2) I am led to believe that the Bureau has records referencing or pertinent to Bronfman that are much more recent than the last records provided. Attached, please find reference to evidence and testimony from the trial of Keith Raniere in Eastern District of New York that there was an intrusion into Mr. Bronfman's electronic mail correspondence. By reasonable inference, the Bureau should possess records of the investigation into this intrusion.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",
