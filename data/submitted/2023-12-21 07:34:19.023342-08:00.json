One of those properties that was recently assessed is 0 Lake St, a thin conservation easement that run between Squire Lane and Reservoir Drive.

If you are one of the abutters conducting these types of actions, we politely ask you to remove your waste by January 1, 2024. This site will be checked again and if this issue has not been resolved, we will have to take further action. If you have any further questions or concerns about what can and cannot be done within a conservation easement, you can reach out to the Conservation Department @ (508) 657-2858 or by emailing hccrawford@bellinghamma.org......\"\r\nIn addition please include the name of the person(s) that brought the issue to the \"attention\" of the conservation commission or any meeting notes discussing the issue.\r\nPlease include the dates that the Conservation Committee visited and assessed the areas in question to \"determine the health of the land they own\"  prior to the letter being sent to the abutters, and their findings of that assessment.\r\nPlease include all the assessments /dates/and maintenance by the town/conservation commission to maintain the  area the Commission has identified as 0 Lake Street between December 1989 to the present.\r\nPlease include any potential conflicts of interest of potential former Conservation Commission members that are also abutters.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.
