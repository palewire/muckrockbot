If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nThis is a copy of my request from October 27, 2022 with two additions: \r\n1) The prior request only includes employees with the titles CORR OFF III, CORR OFFICER IV, and CORR OFFICER V. In this request, I would like data for all security staff and correctional supervisors employed at all TDCJ units. \r\n2) The age or birth date of each TDCJ employee.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",
