Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - November 30, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nIf materials are not available for the requested timeframes, please let me know for which periods they are available. We understand that not all recordkeeping systems facilitate convenient access to some materials. \r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-500-7123. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by Gannett Co., Inc., the ultimate parent corporation of the Democrat & Chronicle, and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. \r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Responsive materials include all law enforcement disciplinary records. \r\n\r\nAccording to FOIL: \r\n\r\n\"Law enforcement disciplinary records\u201d means any record created in furtherance of a law enforcement disciplinary proceeding, including, but not limited to:\r\n(a) the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee;\r\n(b) the name of the employee complained of or charged;\r\n(c) the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing;\r\n(d) the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding; and\r\n(e) the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the\r\nagency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered\r\nemployee.\"\r\n\r\nThis request and materials responsive to it include *all* records held in the possession of any office or individual employed or formerly employed by this policing agency, including those kept off-site, beyond the required retention period, in digital form, and in personnel files.\r\n\r\nPlease note that any failure to provide all potentially-responsive materials and/or the destruction of materials potentially responsive to this request would be a violation of the spirit of the New York Freedom of Information Law, as well as unlawful under the New York FOIL and the terms of the attached litigation hold notice.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 all complaints, reports, records of discipline and penalties, aggregate collections of complaint and disciplinary materials (spreadsheets, databases), investigatory materials, relevant related correspondence, photographs, video, other related evidence, proof of discipline or fulfillment of penalties, and all personnel materials (including those used in promotion, contract, and other employment negotiations and considerations) that reference or utilize misconduct allegations or disciplinary materials of any sort.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include all complaints\u2014 internal, external, and civilian \u2014 and include records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident/complaint: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the investigation, investigatory materials, the disposition of the case, and any subsequent materials related to the execution of any resultant discipline. Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

As much data related to each import instance is appreciated, but most important is \"Carrier Name Carrier used to import or export,\" \"Importer/Exporter Business Name,\" \"Importer/Exporter State,\" \"Importer/Exporter Zip,\" \"FSR Country,\" \"Quantity,\" and \"Units.\" If it is easier to send more data including more than just live Bradypus and Chloepus, which could also include scientific specimens, that is no problem so long as I am able to filter out live sloths. I would appreciate this information in a spreadsheet file, although I'm open to other file types. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as an \u201cother-use\u201d requester.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 After taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, and that our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Your request falls into the Normal processing track. Delay \r\nThe Headquarters FOIA Office is currently experiencing a backlog of request. This is due to retirements, turnovers, and or absences. We apologize for the delay in processing your request.

Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nFor emails I request production of emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBHS Wolverines",

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cto\u201d that individual?

Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I am making a first installment in response to your request for records. You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\n425-456-4101\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>",

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Any network breaches or cyber attacks that have occurred within your organization, including any records of unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise from January 1, 2018 to the present.\r\n2. Any internal investigations or reviews conducted in response to a suspected or confirmed network breach, including any reports, findings, or recommendations.\r\n3. Any incident response plans or policies in place to address network breaches, including any procedures for mitigating and remediating the effects of such incidents.\r\n4. Any communications between your organization and affected individuals, customers, or partners regarding network breaches or incidents.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with the New York Freedom of Information Law. If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation.\r\n\r\nI also request a waiver of all fees in connection with this request as disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. If the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within five business days.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: 1-845-748-0329\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please include all policies and procedures related to how fees are set, accrued, imposed, collected, and enforced (such as those related to per diem fees, ability to pay determinations, penalties for late or non-payment, authorization for civil or criminal action for payment enforcement, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed  to this department or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of individuals charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nThe collections processed  by Commissary and Trust Fund and Accounting and Business Services for room and board and inmate medical fees are for fiscal year 2021.\r\n\r\nAttached is Government Code 501.014, which relates to inmate money and Governor Abbott's waiver of health care fees, effective March 20, 2020. TDCJ did not assess new charges for medical visits in FY 2021 after March 20, 2020. For the attached Commissary & Trust Fund chart, note that \"Charged\" is an accumulated amount of medical fees charged and medical fees refunded to an inmate within the reporting month.  In FY 2021,  the agency did not assess new medical fees; therefore, the amount shown as a negative is the amount refunded to inmates for prior medical visits.  \"Collected\" is the total amount that is otherwise collected from an inmate trust fund account for a previously charged medical visit.\r\nRoom and Board is only collected for the Prison Industry Enhancement Program.\r\n\r\nAlso responsive to your request, see the attachment and the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tdcj.texas.gov/documents/Offender_Orientation_Handbook_English.pdf (pp. 39-40)\r\n\r\nOur office now considers your request (0882-06-2023, which was inadvertently assigned a duplicate PIR number, 0883-06-2023) closed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nOffice of the General Counsel-TDCJ\r\nP: (936) 437-6700\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this email and any attachments is intended for the exclusive use of the addressee(s) and may contain confidential, privileged, or proprietary information.

Mailing and shipping\r\ncosts are also charged when applicable.  Please be aware that pursuant to\r\nWis. Stat. 19.35(3)(f), MATC may require prepayment for record requests if\r\nthe total exceeds five dollars ($5.00).\r\n\r\nWe will provide you with a reasonable estimate of application fees if the\r\ntotal is estimated to exceed $5.00.  You may indicate then whether you want\r\naccess to the records or copies of the records.

Do not presume the passage of time between your request and MATC\u2019s\r\nresponse means that the request has been denied. If you have any questions\r\nregarding this, please reply to this email.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including employee identification numbers, home addresses, personal phone numbers, medical information, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Certain redactions have been made or records withheld pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a) and the corresponding 105 ILCS 5/34-18.5(b) which prohibits the release of background check information. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Please note, there are no records responsive to the portions of this request seeking Investigative Memorandums 9506 and 9207. Further, Investigative Memorandum 9500 has been withheld entirely pursuant to section 7(1)(c) of the FOIA and section 7 (1)(a) of the FOIA and the corresponding section 34-18.5(b) of the School Code, as detailed above. Reports 9504 and 9505 are being withheld from release as they have been determined to be factual information inextricably intertwined\u00a0with an ongoing\u00a0investigation or disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(n) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(f) states \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)] Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" (Id. at 248, 799 N.E.2d at 864). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Peirce Elementary \r\n2. Budlong Elementary \r\n3. Holden Elementary \r\n\r\nTime frame: July 1, 2021 to current \r\n\r\nAdditionally, supply any/all reports related to EOCO complaint settlements and/or resolutions. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, race/ethnicity, medical information, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Illinois state law prohibits the release of teacher\u00a0performance\u00a0evaluations. Per 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1, \u201cDisclosure of public school teacher, principal, and superintendent performance evaluations is prohibited,\u201d and 820 ILCS 40/11, \u201cDisclosure of performance evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act shall be prohibited,\u201d and related documents have been removed. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(d) of the FOIA which provides that \u201c[r]ecords in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings\u2026 to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(d)(iv). Certain records were withheld from release as they have been determined to be factual information inextricably intertwined\u00a0with an ongoing\u00a0investigation or disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(n) of the FOIA. Section 7(1)(f) states \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.
