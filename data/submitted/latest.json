        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRe:  Expedited Freedom of Information Act \r\n\r\nATTENTION: \r\nGovernment Spying Transparency Project (\u201cGSTP\u201d) makes this expedited request for records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) regulations.  Specifically, GSTP requests all records and communications from June 2, 2020 to the present that  pertain to: \r\n1. DHS or it\u2019s various agencies and components investigations, assessments and other intelligence gathering on individuals and groups related to protest activity or criminal activity related to protest activity in Portland, Oregon at or near federal buildings, offices, infrastructure or employees.\r\n \r\nPlease search for responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.  We seek records of any kind, including paper records, electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, photographs, data, and graphical material.  Our request includes without limitation all correspondence, letters, emails, text messages, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages, and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations, or discussions.  Our request also includes any attachments to emails and other records, as well as those who were cc\u2019ed or bcc\u2019ed on any emails. If it is your position any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, GSTP requests that you provide it with an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  In the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).  If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non/U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977). \r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER REQUEST:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A) and DHS regulations, GSTP requests a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records.  The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures likely will contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by GSTP and the general public in a significant way.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).  Moreover, the request primarily and fundamentally is for non-commercial purposes.  See, e.g., McClellan Ecological v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1285 (9th Cir. 1987).\r\n\r\nGSTP intends to share the information responsive to this request with the public through reports, press releases, or other means.  In addition, GSTP will disseminate any documents it acquires from this request to the public through its website, www.muckrock.com.  The release of information obtained through this request is not in GSTP\u2019s financial interest.  GSTP further requests that it not be charged search or review fees for this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) because GSTP qualifies as a member of the news media.  See Nat\u2019l Sec. Archive v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1386 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding non-profit a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and broadly interpreting the term to include \u201cany person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates information to the public\u201d).  GSTP routinely and systematically disseminates information to the public in several ways.  Under these circumstances, GSTP satisfies fully the criteria for a fee waiver. \r\n\r\nEXPEDITION \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that GSTP is seeking expedition of this request and pursuant to DHS FOIA regulations requests expedited handling of this request due to great public interest.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, please produce records in electronic format.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",

The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Minnesota from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Minnesota. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Minneapolis FBI Field Office, Minnesota Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",

The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Washington from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Washington. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Seattle FBI Field Office, Washington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
