The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on expedited processing within 10 calendar days and a substantive response to this request within 20 working days. Please provide acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number for this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Waiver Justification",

The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on expedited processing within 10 calendar days and a substantive response to this request within 20 working days. Please provide acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number for this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Waiver Justification",

The FOIA establishes a strong statutory presumption in favor of disclosure, placing the burden on the agency to justify withholding requested information. This presumption has been consistently recognized and enforced by federal courts. In support of this request, I reference the following authoritative case law and statutory provisions:\r\n\r\n1. **Department of the Air Force v. Rose**, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976): Establishing that FOIA mandates a \"general philosophy of full agency disclosure\" and that exemptions must be \"narrowly construed.\"\r\n\r\n2. **NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co.**, 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978): Reinforcing that FOIA's \"basic purpose reflected 'a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.'\"\r\n\r\n3. **FBI v. Abramson**, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982): Affirming that \"FOIA exceptions are to be narrowly construed.\"\r\n\r\n4. **United States Department of Justice v. Julian**, 486 U.S. 1, 8 (1988): Holding that the FOIA's \"mandate of disclosure\" requires federal agencies to disclose records unless they are specifically exempted.\r\n\r\n5. **Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice**, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989): Emphasizing the public's right to access government records to ensure governmental accountability.\r\n\r\n6. **U.S. Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts**, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989): Confirming that agency financial records fall within FOIA's disclosure mandate and supporting the principle that FOIA requests need not demonstrate a \"need to know.\"\r\n\r\n7. **Milner v. Department of the Navy**, 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011): Reiterating that FOIA \"requires federal agencies to make Government records available to the public, subject to nine exemptions for specific categories of material.\"\r\n\r\n8. **ACLU v. Department of Defense**, 543 F.3d 59, 66 (2d Cir. 2008): Holding that \"FOIA was enacted to promote honest and open government and to assure the existence of an informed citizenry in order to hold the governors accountable to the governed.\"\r\n\r\n9. **Multi Ag Media LLC v. Department of Agriculture**, 515 F.3d 1224, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 2008): Finding that disclosure of financial information in government possession serves FOIA's purpose of permitting public scrutiny of agency action.\r\n\r\n10. **Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System**, 601 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2010): Compelling disclosure of central bank financial records, establishing precedent for disclosure of government financial holdings.\r\n\r\n11. **American Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Homeland Security**, 627 F.3d 227, 243 (D.C. Cir. 2010): Reiterating that the presumption of openness applies even when the records relate to government operations affecting public accountability.\r\n\r\n12. **Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Department of Justice**, 416 F. Supp. 2d 30, 37 (D.D.C. 2006): Holding that \"FOIA's purpose is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society.\"\r\n\r\n13. **National Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish**, 541 U.S. 157, 171-172 (2004): Reaffirming that FOIA's central purpose is to ensure that government activities are \"opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny.\"\r\n\r\n14. **Cause of Action v. Federal Trade Commission**, 799 F.3d 1108, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2015): Emphasizing that FOIA's goal is \"to pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\"\r\n\r\n15. **Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy**, 827 F.3d 145, 150 (D.C. Cir. 2016): Holding that records relating to government business are subject to FOIA regardless of where they are stored.\r\n\r\n16. **Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Service**, 726 F.3d 208, 216 (D.C. Cir. 2013): Defining agency records broadly to include materials that an agency has created, obtained, or controlled.\r\n\r\n17. **EPIC v. DHS**, 999 F.3d 669, 675 (D.C. Cir. 2021): Reinforcing that the burden is on the agency to prove that requested documents fall within a FOIA exemption, not on the requester to prove they do not.\r\n\r\n18. **Center for Investigative Reporting v. U.S. Department of Justice**, 982 F.3d 668 (9th Cir. 2020): Limiting the application of Exemption 7(A) for law enforcement records, particularly when related to completed enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this extensive case law, I note that the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (Public Law No. 114-185) further strengthens the presumption of openness by codifying the \"foreseeable harm\" standard, requiring agencies to withhold information only if \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\" or \"disclosure is prohibited by law.\" This statutory requirement places an additional burden on the agency to justify any withholding of the requested records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the OPEN Government Act of 2007 (Public Law No. 110-175) emphasizes timely responses to FOIA requests and mandates greater agency accountability in FOIA processing.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and Treasury FOIA regulations at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.7(k), I request a waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. **Public Interest Criterion:** Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it will significantly contribute to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically:\r\n\r\n   a) The requested records concern the operations and activities of the federal government in managing significant financial assets in the form of cryptocurrencies;\r\n\r\n   b) Disclosure will significantly enhance the public's understanding of how the Treasury Department manages digital assets, particularly in light of Executive Order 14178 establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve;\r\n\r\n   c) The records will reveal how public funds and seized assets are being handled, providing transparency into an area of government activity that has received minimal public disclosure to date;\r\n\r\n   d) These records will contribute to the public's understanding of the implementation of a significant new government initiative that potentially impacts U.S. financial and monetary policy.\r\n\r\n2. **News Media Dissemination:** As an investigative journalist, I will use these records to analyze and report on the Treasury Department's cryptocurrency activities through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience and enhancing public understanding of this government function.\r\n\r\n3. **Not Primarily Commercial Interest:** The primary purpose of this request is journalistic and in the public interest, not for commercial benefit. Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government activities.\r\n\r\nShould you deny this fee waiver request, please notify me before incurring any costs exceeding $100. In such case, I reserve the right to appeal the denial of the fee waiver and/or modify the scope of the request to reduce applicable fees.\r\n\r\n EXPEDITED PROCESSING REQUEST:\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.5(e), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to:\r\n\r\n1. An urgency to inform the public about federal government activity that involves questions about the government's integrity, particularly regarding the implementation of Executive Order 14178 and the establishment of cryptocurrency reserves using public funds;\r\n\r\n2. The matter is of widespread and exceptional media interest, with significant questions about the government's financial management practices that affect public confidence.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. **Emails and Electronic Communications:**\r\n   - Provide in .MSG, .EML, or similar format that preserves all header information\r\n   - Include all attachments as separate files in their native formats\r\n   - Preserve complete metadata including routing information, timestamps, and delivery information\r\n   - Maintain threading and conversation indices\r\n   - Include server logs associated with transmission and receipt where available\r\n\r\n2. **Structured Data:**\r\n   - Provide databases in their native format or as complete exports (SQL dumps, CSV, JSON, or XML)\r\n   - Include data dictionaries, schema documentation, and relationship diagrams\r\n   - Preserve all field names, table structures, and relationship information\r\n\r\n3. **Documents and Reports:**\r\n   - Provide in native format (e.g., .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX) rather than as images\r\n   - If converted to PDF, ensure they are text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\n   - Preserve version history information where available\r\n\r\n4. **Blockchain Data:**\r\n   - Provide wallet addresses and transaction hashes in machine-readable format\r\n   - Include blockchain explorer exports where available\r\n   - Maintain cryptographic integrity of any provided signatures or keys\r\n\r\n5. **Calendar Items and Meeting Records:**\r\n   - Provide in .ICS or similar format that preserves attendee information and recurrence data\r\n   - Include meeting minutes as separate attachments in native format\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive preservation of metadata is essential to understanding the context, authenticity, and complete nature of the records being sought.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF RECORDS AND RIGHT TO APPEAL:\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved intact and without redaction pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\n1. You provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption;\r\n\r\n2. You release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of documents containing redacted material, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b);\r\n\r\n3. For each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if the Department fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on this request within 20 working days, unless expedited processing is granted, in which case a response is expected within 10 calendar days. Please provide a tracking number for this request \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",
