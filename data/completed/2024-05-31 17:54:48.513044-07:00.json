If this is the case, I assume that you mean to claim that all responsive records are considered exempt by the City under RCW 42.56.240(4), which covers security information such as passwords, access codes, security plans, etc.\r\n\r\nAre you claiming that even the knowledge of the city's usage of basic software, such as Microsoft Word or Outlook, would risk the security of the city? Because that could only mean to me that the City has set up a very insecure, perhaps negligent, security environment. In fact, other MuckRock requesters have been provided similar records from the City of Seattle (see https://www.muckrock.com/foi/seattle-69/seattle-police-itd-authorized-software-department-of-information-technology-101093/).\r\n\r\nMay I remind you that the Washington Public Records Act RCW 42.56.030 is to be \"liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed\". I respectfully ask that I be provided with the full breadth of the requested information and will be considering my options for asserting my rights under the PRA.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

Again, I must reiterate from my last message that the security of City hardware cannot possibly depend on withholding the names of hardware such as computer monitors etc in the City's inventory. According to guidelines written by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), \"[s]ystem security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.\" (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-123.pdf) On the other hand, there is a significant public interest to know what hardware the City has acquired with taxpayer money and how it is being operated.\r\n\r\nIf there is a particular device where even knowing of its existence would threaten City security, that device should be individually redacted rather than withholding the full file. I do not consider this response to be adequate and again ask that you provide the full breadth of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

In this regard, I would like to point out that my request specifically referenced a quote from Dr. James McDonald, Commissioner of Health. Therefore, I suggest beginning the search for responsive documents with Dr. McDonald and his office, including any communications and materials presented to him regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is crucial to include records from external parties who have provided information to the Health Commissioner that influenced his public health recommendations. This includes, but is not limited to, data or studies that support the assertion that vaccination can prevent individuals from being \u201csick for the holidays,\u201d especially considering the biological variability among individuals and the time required to develop immunity.\r\n\r\nGiven the public interest in understanding the basis for health recommendations made by state officials, I urge a thorough and expedient review of relevant documents. Please consider this letter as a clarification to my initial FOIL request, focusing on Dr. McDonald\u2019s office and related external communications.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and the timely processing of my request.",

While I appreciate the complexities involved in such a request, the extended timeline for completion, now projected to be March 19, 2024, raises significant concerns.\r\n\r\nThe urgency of this request stems not only from its public health implications but also from the need to understand the basis for public health recommendations that seemingly do not account for individual biological variability. The statements made by public health officials, which prompted this FOIL request, suggest a one-size-fits-all approach to vaccine efficacy, which may not adequately consider the diverse responses of individuals to the vaccine.\r\n\r\nGiven the potential impact of these recommendations on public understanding and decision-making, it is imperative that any data or communications used to formulate these recommendations be made available promptly. Therefore, I request a rolling release of documents as they are identified and reviewed. This approach will facilitate timely public access to information that is crucial for informed discourse and decision-making.\r\n\r\nI urge you to prioritize the release of any documents that have already been identified, even if the search and review process for the entire request is ongoing. The provision of this information in a timely manner is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring that health recommendations are based on a comprehensive understanding of the data.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

        "communication": "Subject: Appeal for FOIL Request Denial - FOIL Request Number: 23-09-211\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Harvey,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the denial of access to records under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) concerning my request dated September 15, 2023, regarding the distribution of COVID-19 tests and masks to schools (FOIL Request Number: 23-09-211).\r\n\r\nDespite receiving extension notices, the most recent of which estimated a completion date of May 3, 2024, there has been a significant delay without the provision of requested records. This delay undermines the principles of transparency and accountability, especially given the public health implications of the information sought.\r\n\r\nPursuant to New York Public Officers Law \u00a789(4)(a), I am appealing the implicit denial resulting from the failure to provide the requested records within the statutory timeframe. The ongoing delays fail to comply with the timely access envisioned by FOIL, and there has been no justification for such extensive delays that would outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nI kindly request a review of this decision and timely access to the requested records. If this appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation, including the statutory exemptions relied upon for denying access to these records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

This request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear, please contact me to allow revisions rather than deny the request. Similarly, if the requested data are available only in part, please fulfill the portion of the request that is available rather than denying it in full. For example, notes or reports are available/subject to release but personal identifying information are not, reply with the report summary and omit sensitive information.\r\n\r\nAtNight Media is a representative of the news media and is primarily engaged in the dissemination of information to the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNik Hatziefstathiou",

This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed ChatGPT and B) Any other documents related to ChatGPT including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any memos or communications sent to schools, administrators, teachers, parents, or students that mention \"ChatGPT.\"\r\n\r\n3) Any case studies, enforcement actions, contracts, or other documents mentioning ChatGPT \r\n\r\n4) Any academic dishonesty policies that mention ChatGPT\r\n\r\n5) To the extent possible, any emails and associated attachments that mention ChatGPT\r\n\r\nTo help limit the extent of the responsive documents, please limit search from Jan 1, 2023 through the time this request is processed. Please deliver these documents on a rolling basis as responsive documents are found. You can treat #5 (emails) as a separate request because I suspect there will be many more responsive documents there.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. It will be used in the course of reporting for Motherboard, VICE's science and tech site (www.motherboard.vice.com).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJason Koebler",

Your request was forwarded from the Department of Veterans Affairs\r\nand received in this office on May 28, 2024, and assigned case number\r\n24-43958.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the repository\r\nfor the permanent and historically valuable records of the United States\r\nFederal Government, which includes those of the U.S. Congress, the U.S.\r\nSupreme Court and federal court system, and the agencies and departments of\r\nthe Executive Branch. Our holdings are not organized by name or subject,\r\nbut are primarily arranged by the federal office or court that created and\r\nmaintained the records, and thereafter by various filing schemes depending\r\non the type of record or the particular function of the federal office or\r\ncourt in question. Moreover, it is important to note that NARA does not\r\nhave a master name and subject index that identifies all documents\r\npertaining to a specific individual, organization, topic, or geographic\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nWith regards to your request, the Archives 1 Reference Branch in\r\nWashington, DC, houses numerous records relating to the Civil War and\r\nincludes records relating to military service. However, we should note that\r\nthe War Department did not create any consolidated personnel files during\r\nthe Civil War, and as such, there is no personnel file for Mary Edwards\r\nWalker. But we checked the Records of the Adjutant General\u2019s Office (Record\r\nGroup 94) and noted the following records are available for Mary Edwards\r\nWalker:\r\n\r\n   - File in the series \u201cPersonal Papers of Medical Officers and\r\n   Physicians\u201d (PI-17 Entry 561; National Archives Identifier 655782\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/655782>) -- 221 pages\r\n   - File W-2068-VS-1863 (Congressional Medal of Honor File) in the series\r\n   \u201cLetters Received by the Volunteer Service Division, 1861\u20131889\u201d (PI-17\r\n   Entry 496; National Archives Identifier 18573415\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18573415>) -- 300 pages\r\n   - File in the series \u201cCase Files Relating to Corrections of Military\r\n   Records, 1961\u20132005\u201d (A1 Entry 814; National Archives Identifier 300358\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300358>)\r\n      - Box 4 in this series contains the transcript of the 1977\r\n      proceedings of the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records\r\n      regarding Walker\u2019s Medal of Honor (National Archives Identifier\r\n      18463647 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18463647>) -- 85 pages\r\n\r\nA reproduction of all of the files referenced above are available for\r\npurchase. Our current fee for paper-to-paper (or paper-to-digital images)\r\nis $0.80 per page. The total number of pages for all three files is\r\napproximately 606 pages, which would bring the total cost for a\r\nreproduction to $484.80. To obtain copies of any or all of these records,\r\nplease email our office directly at archives1reference@nara.gov. In your\r\ncorrespondence, please reference the case number as \"RR1R-24-43958-JD.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we also checked the Records of the Department of Veterans\r\nAffairs (Record Group 15) and located a pension file (#SC 142,715) for Mary\r\nEdwards Walker. A reproduction of this pension file is available for\r\npurchase and can be ordered online using form NATF 85. Please submit your\r\nrequest via the NARA website at the following address:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/pre-ww-1-records.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA's fee and fee waiver provisions do not apply to\r\narchival records. The fee statute, 44 U.S.C. 2116(c), does apply. It does\r\nnot authorize NARA to waive reproduction charges for individual requesters,\r\nand our inability to grant a fee waiver does not constitute a denial for\r\nthe purposes of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please note that the records in Record Group 94 and Record\r\nGroup 15 that we noted above are open and available to the public and do\r\nnot require a FOIA request to access them. As such, you do not need to\r\nsubmit a FOIA request to obtain copies or view them in person. And with\r\nregards to the latter, you are welcome to visit our facility in Washington,\r\nDC, to view the records in our research room. While appointments are no\r\nlonger required, we do encourage interested researchers in making a\r\nresearch room room appointment. To do so, please click on the following\r\nlink: National Archives in Washington, DC (Research)\r\n<https://www.eventbrite.com/o/national-archives-in-washington-dc-research-48144467593>.\r\nOur DC building page can be found at: https://www.archives.gov/dc.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request. If you have any questions,\r\nyou may reach me via email at john.deeben@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we were able to locate records pertaining to your subject and\r\nhave provided you with instructions on how to obtain reproductions. Since\r\nthe records cited above are open and available to the public, you do not\r\nneed to file a Freedom of Information Act request to access them. However,\r\nif you are not satisfied with our action on this request, your options for\r\nappeal and dispute resolution are outlined in the attached enclosure.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJOHN P.

        "communication": "Dear Russel,\r\n\r\nYour registration with Office of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email was completed successfully. Now that you've registered with Office of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email, communicating securely is easy!\r\n\r\nAs you know, Office of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email protects our confidential correspondences by using the same security technologies as internet banking when sending and receiving sensitive email messages. But you likely didn't know that this service allows you to do so much more than address security and compliance, or guarantee delivery of messages that prevent statements such as \"I never received it\".\r\n\r\nOffice of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email includes a patented Delivery Slip - a powerful tool for users that provides many features for increased efficiencies and control over sensitive messages and attachments. It is found on the right side of  all secure message, both in this Secure Message Center and your desktop Microsoft Outlook program ('Enable with MS Office Outlook').\r\n\r\n5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip\r\n\r\nHere's just 5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip that you probably never thought possible with basic email:\r\n\r\n1. Know what happens to your secure message once it's sent. Track and prove when a secure message and attachment is received, read, replied to, forwarded, deleted or printed.\r\n\r\n2. Send jumbo files via email. Now you can simply attach that 100 MB file to a message without having to find an external service to share it.\r\n\r\n3. Completely recall a secure message - and it works! Now you can instantly retract a secure message and attachment - even days or weeks after the recipient has read the message - resulting in the recipient's inability to access or read the recalled secure message.\r\n\r\n4. Prevent a recipient from forwarding or replying to a secure message; or prevent a recipient from printing or saving a message or attachment.\r\n\r\n5. Add extra security for ultra-sensitive content with 'For Your Eyes Only' by including an additional password required for the message or attachment to be opened by the recipient. Also prevents internal or external access by email delegates.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the benefits of  Office of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email unique features: http://www.appriver.com/\r\n\r\nThank you, and we're glad to have you as part of Office of the Arizona State Treasurer  Secure Email!\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n--------------- BEGIN E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------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\r\n\r\n--------------- END E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attached letter is in reference to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated and received on September 19, 2019.  You asked for a copy of any internal communications between Department of Housing and Urban Development employees up to and including the director which include the words \"transgender\" and/or \"transsexual\" and/or \"transgenders\" and/or \"trannies.\"  Including, any electronic messaging, policy development documentation, legal communications, between other government agencies, and handwritten notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that HUD will comply with your request to the extent permissible by law.  Any records not subject to an exemption will be forwarded to you promptly upon completion of the Department's search and review process.  However, your request is too broad and vague to be processed.  Asking for copies of internal communications between employees up to and including the director doesn't provide a narrow enough scope.  The Department performs electronic searches by custodial names, has many employees at HUD, and you haven't provided any HUD employee names in which to utilize for a search.  Also, you initially state, \"internal communications\" and then later state \"communications between other US government agencies.\" You need to specify whose records you want, or, if you truly only want internal records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease clarify your request within 15 business days from the date of this letter.  If I do not hear from you within that time, your request will be withdrawn.  Please be advised that such an action will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future.  If you wish to clarify your request, please email your clarification to eugene.a.mcgirt@hud.gov<mailto:eugene.a.mcgirt@hud.gov> or submit it to the following address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\r\n\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat, FOIA Branch\r\n\r\n451 Seventh Street, SW, Room 10139\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20410-3000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention:  Eugene McGirt\r\nTelephone:  (202) 402-4315",

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Crose, This is in response to your August 20, 2020, email for a status of your FOIA request 19-FI-HQ-02010. As was conveyed to you in the Department\u2019sinitial acknowledgement letter, once HUD properly receives a FOIA request, theDepartment has 20 business days within which to make a determination on therequest unless unusual circumstances exist. Under unusual circumstances, HUDcan extend the 20-day time limit for processing a request. Currently, along with the present incoming FOIA requests, we arestill working to complete your FOIA request as well as all the other backloggedFOIA requests. In addition, y our request asksfor electronic communications and/or calendar entries of at least one HUDemployee. Your request requires utilization of the Department\u2019s eDiscovery toolto search for responsive records. The Department\u2019s eDiscovery tool iscontracted with a third-party that uses a system which auto-assigns acollection date on a first-in and first-out basis and is only capable ofcollecting records for a set number of custodians per day.\u00a0 As a result,the Department does not maintain direct control over the collection process andcannot alter the scheduled collection date for a particular request.\u00a0Given the high volume of requests for eDiscovery searches, the third-partysystem is operating at capacity with a significant backlog.\u00a0 Once therecord collection has been completed, responsive records will be delivered tothe FOIA Branch for review.\u00a0 At that time, we will work diligently tofinalize your request as quickly as possible. Your eDiscovery search requesthas been scheduled to begin October 22, 2020. Our effort is to provide responses to\u00a0all FOIA requesterswho\u00a0are still interested in receiving them. In doingso, w e must apply the Departments\u2019 first in and first out FOIAprocedures, as there are many requests surrounding each other.\u00a0 However,if you are still interested, I assure you that we will provide a response toyour request as soon as possible. Please, let me know, via email to me at yourearliest convenience, whether or not you are still interested in receiving aresponse to your Department of Housing and Urban Development FOIA request. You must confirm\u00a0via email atwilliam.d.smith@hud.gov to me within 10 business days from the date of thisnotice that you want to continue with your request. If you do not confirm thatyou are still interested in receiving a response to your HUD FOIA requestwithin that time, your request will be administratively withdrawn. Please beadvised that such an action will not preclude you from filing this or otherrequests in the future. The Department apologizes for the delay in processing your FOIArequest. HUD has experienced changes that have contributed to a tremendousbacklog and extensive delays in the ability to process incoming requests in atimely manner and as stated, w e will work diligently to finalize yourrequest as quickly as possible. If you wish to modify your FOIA request for any reason at thistime, please send your request modification to me via my email address shownabove, at william.d.smith@hud.gov ,as soon as possible to enable the Department to initiate the process for anappropriate response to you. Also, you may contact the Office ofGovernment Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and RecordsAdministration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0The contact information for OGIS is as follows:  Officeof Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601Adelphi Road-OGIS CollegePark, Maryland 20740-6001 Telephone: 202-741-5770, toll free at 1-877-684-6448 FAX:202- 741-5769 Email:at ogis@nara.gov If you decide to appeal, your appeal should include copies ofyour original request and this response, as well as a discussion of the reasonssupporting the appeal.

Under unusual circumstances, such as an agency\u2019s backlog, or the need to examine a voluminous amount of records required by the request, HUD can extend the 20-day time limit for processing a request.  Presently, unusual and exceptional circumstances exist.\r\n\r\nAs was previously relayed to you, HUD has experienced FOIA staff changes that have contributed to a tremendous backlog and extensive delays in the ability to process incoming requests in a timely manner. Other changes as well as field policy changes that have contributed to a tremendous backlog and extensive delays in the ability to process incoming requests in a timely manner. Our effort is to provide responses to all FOIA requesters who are still interested in receiving them.   In doing so, we must apply the Departments\u2019 first in and first out FOIA procedures, as there are many requests surrounding each other.\r\nTherefore, we are asking that you please keep in mind the following:\r\n1.  Presently unusual and exceptional circumstances exists within the Department\u2019s FOIA processing program;\r\n2.  Although the FOIA provides a right of access to federal agency records that exist and can be located in federal agency files, the FOIA does not require agencies to conduct research for requesters, to analyze data,\r\n     to answer questions, to create new records (such as lists or statistics) in response to a FOIA request or provide regular updates; and\r\n\u200b\r\n3.  You have an option to reschedule your FOIA request by amending your request to reduce its volume or withdraw your request for a later date more suitable.\r\n\r\nYou may modify your request to assist in avoiding further delays in attempt to meet a deadline due date, if any, and/or to reduce FOIA fees when any.  If you wish to modify your FOIA request for any reason, at this time, please send your request modification to me via my email address shown above at william.d.smith@hud.gov, within 10 business days from the date of this notice as soon as possible to enable the Department to initiate the process for an appropriate response to you.  Again, If I don\u2019t hear from you within that time, the Department will conclude that you do not want to modify your request to reduce its volume nor withdraw your request for a later date more suitable for you.\r\n\r\nThe Department apologizes for any delay occurrences while processing your FOIA request.\r\n\u200bThe FOIA Public Liaison is responsible for increasing transparency, understanding the status of requests, and resolving disputes between you and the agency.  If you need assistance in any of these matters please send an email to Deborah R. Snowden at FOIAExecSec@hud.gov<mailto:Deborah%20R.%20Snowden%20at%20FOIAExecSec@hud.gov>.\r\nAlso, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows:\r\n                                                Office of Government Information Services\r\n                                                National Archives and Records Administration\r\n                                                8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS\r\n                                                College Park, Maryland 20740-6001\r\n\u200b\r\n                                                Telephone: 202-741-5770, toll free at 1-877- 684-6448\r\n                                                FAX: 202- 741-5769\r\n\u200b                                                Email: at ogis@nara.gov\r\n\u200b\r\nIf you decide to appeal, your appeal should include copies of your original request and this response, as well as a discussion of the reasons supporting the appeal.   The envelope should be plainly marked to indicate that it contains a FOIA appeal and be addressed to:\r\n\r\n                                    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\r\n                                                Attention:  FOIA Appeals\r\n                                                Office of General Counsel\r\n                                                Office of Ethics and Appeals Law Division\r\n                                                451 Seventh Street, SW, Suite 2130\r\n                                                Washington, DC 20410\r\n                                                Telephone: (202) 708-3815\r\n\u200b\r\nYou may also submit your appeal via email at HUDFOIAappeasls@hud.gov<mailto:HUDFOIAappeasls@hud.gov>.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe await your response and thank you for your interest in the Department\u2019s programs and policies.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Smith\r\nFOIA Branch",

Your request was received in the Department\u2019s FOIA Office on September 19, 2019.\r\nPursuant to the FOIA, 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i), once HUD properly receives a FOIA request, the Department has 20 working days within which to make a determination on the request unless unusual circumstances exist. Under unusual circumstances, such as an agency\u2019s backlog, or the need to examine a voluminous amount of records required by the request, HUD can extend the 20-day time limit for processing a request. As of June 6, 2023, HUD\u2019s FOIA Office has a large number of open FOIA requests ahead of yours. Based upon HUD\u2019s experience and current inventory, it is estimated that it may take an extended amount of time to complete processing of your request.  I will look towards having an interim response provided you, should you inform me that you will accept an interim response via email to me, as soon as possible, at william.d.smith@hud.gov<mailto:william.d.smith@hud.gov>.\r\nHUD\u2019s policy is to process FOIA requests using \u201cmulti-track processing,\u201d which allows the Department to process FOIA requests on a first-in/first-out basis, within each track. HUD places FOIA requests in its routine or complex track based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. The criteria for assignment to a specific track are found in HUD\u2019s FOIA regulations, 24 CFR 15.105(a), which were published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2001, at 66 FR 6964. Your request is being processed on the routine track. Please note that upon further evaluation of your request, you may be notified that your request has been transferred to another track.\r\nThe Department will comply with your request to the extent permissible by law. Any records not subject to an exemption will be forwarded to you promptly upon the completion of HUD\u2019s search and review process. Your request has been assigned to William Smith for processing. If you have any questions regarding your request, please contact me, William Smith,  at william.d.smith@hud.gov<mailto:william.d.smith@hud.gov> .\r\nThank you for your interest in the Department\u2019s programs and policies.\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Smith\r\nHUD FOIA OFFICE",

        "communication": "MuckRock News (Jasper Craven),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     In review of your FOIA request we have determined that we need further clarification and scoping to continue processing it.  In accordance with VA's implementing regulations, found at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.554(d)(4), I am providing you with 30 calendar days to reply to our clarification on your request.  If our office has not heard from you by October 13, 2023, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing the FOIA request and will take the appropriate measures to administratively close it.  Please keep in mind that the timeframe which we must respond to your FOIA request stopped, while we are waiting your response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn your request you sought the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.      All complaints, reports, and patient safety data -- including Serious Reportable Events, Hospital Acquired Conditions as reported to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicators -- for provider associated with the VA's Veteran Community Care Program (VCCP).  Much of this data is collected through the department's third-party administrators, including TriWest and Optum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.      Please also provide the Clinical Quality Monitoring Plans implemented by the TPAs, which are required to include quality monitoring activities for patient safety, clinical quality assurance, clinical quality improvement, and peer review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.      Finally, please provide all information, mandated under federal contracts, that TPAs collect in their efforts to identify, track, trend, and report interventions to resolve any potential or identified quality issues.  (The creation and collection of this information is detailed in recent Congressional testimony here:  https://docs.house.gov/meetings/VR/VR03/20220714/114988/HHRG-117-VR03-Wstate-LaPuzM-20220714-U1.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In response to item #1 while it describes the requested records, your request is too broad and imposes an unreasonable burden on the office searching for responsive records.  Specifically, the portion of item #1 stating \"All complaints, reports and patient safety data... for provider(s) associated with the VA's Veteran Community Care Program (VCCP)\" is overly broad as those requested items can be submitted to multiple VA programs and offices (such as, but not limited to:  VA Office of General Counsel, Veteran Crisis Hotline, all VA Medical Centers, White house VA Hotline etc.) as well as encompassing multiple complaints/reports/patient safety data record types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Based on the aforementioned factors, your request falls under the category of not reasonably described, and therefore we ask that you modify your request to begin search with reasonable parameters, thereby ensuring a manageable processing time.  A suggestion is the limitation of the search, within the purview of the Office of Integrated Veteran Care, is a request for complaints/reports/patients safety submitted to the Office of Integrated Veteran Care by the Third-Party Administrators (TriWest and Optum).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     If you select this option, please note that the current identified documents (for the period of June 6, 2019, to August 16, 2023), under the possession of the VHA/IVC would result in an estimated final production of January 15, 2024, please consider scoping the timeframe to a one-year period or documents submitted via one of the two TPAs (vice both TPAs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     If you have further questions or would like to request a meeting to discuss your request, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I am writing to let you know that at this time, I have logged two hours getting these statistics pulled for your request. I am estimating at least another two hours to complete the rest of the research. Once the research is completed, I will send you a cost letter for your request, and we will require payment be received before we are able to share that information with you. I am expected to be out most of next week for medical reasons, so your request may not get filled until the second week of April. If you have any questions please feel free to email me.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nChelsea Boyd\r\nAdministrative Assistant\r\nRecords Division\r\ncrboyd@cityofbartlesville.org\r\nP: 918-338-4021\r\nF: 918-338-4043",

First, we have a revised total for the court documents -  1789 pages, rather than 1685 pages. Also, we need to have an agreement from you to pay for the remaining pages before we proceed. The total, should all the remaining pages be released is now $505 (34 CDs at $15 each, less $5 credit for the first CD).

The redactions in the enclosed documents consist of information protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nIn addition, HISD has determined that some of the responsive information to your below request may not be released pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") as the information requested contains students' \"personally identifiable information.\"  \"Personally identifiable information\" includes, but is not limited to, the following information:\r\n\r\n  1.  the student's name;\r\n  2.  the name of the student's parent or other family member;\r\n  3.  the address of the student or the student's family;\r\n  4.  a personal identifier, such as the student's social security number or student number;\r\n  5.  Other indirect identifiers, such as the student's date of birth, place of birth, and mother's maiden name;\r\n  6.  Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty; or\r\n  7.  Information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates.\r\n34 CFR \u00a7 99.3, \"Personally identifiable information.\" (Emphasis added.)  Thus, FERPA-protected information may not be released in any form that would allow the student to be identified (unless there is a specific exception to the written consent requirement).\r\nHISD has determined that even after redacting all nominally identifying information from the requested information, the records contain information that may reveal students' identities.  In addition, this information may be withheld without the necessity of seeking an Attorney General ruling.

Your request is granted in part and denied in part. A responsive record is attached.    \u00a0  An agency may interpret the meaning of a request for records, but that interpretation must be reasonable.\u201d Barosh v. Phila. Fire Dep\u2019t, O.O.R. Dkt. AP 2015-2148 (Pa. O.O.R. Oct. 27, 2015); Spatz\r\nv. City of Reading, O.O.R. Dkt. AP 2013-0867, 2013 PA O.O.R.D. Lexis 513. The City has interpreted your request as seeking the Citywide email sent to staff on May 20, 2024 announcing a transition to in-person work starting July 15, 2025. To the extent you intended to seek other records, your request is denied as insufficiently specific. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.\u00a0  \u00a0     Your request does not specify a transaction or activity of the City, but rather seeks all email from more than 25,000 City employees for a period of nearly 1.5 years with broad search terms.\u00a0Among other things, the RTKL requires that a written request\u00a0\u201cidentify or describe the records sought with sufficient\r\nspecificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested\r\n. . . .\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.**\u00a0The requirement of specificity is necessary to (1) ensure that a requestor provides enough information so that \u201can agency can determine whether to grant or deny the request[;]\u201d\u00a0Nanayakkara v. Casella,\r\n681 A.2d 857, 859-60 (Pa. Commw. 1996), and (2) \u201cto prevent agencies from suffering undue interference and obstruction of their daily functions; . . . [which] would be unavoidable if agency officials always could be subjected to broad and unlimited requests for documents and records.\u201d\u00a0Mooney v. Temple Univ. of the Commonwealth Sys. Of Higher Educ. Bd. Of\r\nTrustees, 292 A.2d 395, 397 n.8 (Pa. 1972) (\u201crequests for inspection [must] be specific and particular seeking disclosure of named documents or records rather than broad and unlimited requests for undefined bodies of documents or records\u201d);\u00a0see also, e.g.,\u00a0Arduino v. Borough of Dunmore, 720 A.2d 827, 831 (Pa. Commw. 1998) (holding that a request for \u201c\u2018all records\u2019 related to the disbursement of the funds for [certain] public projects\u201d lacked sufficient specificity),\u00a0appeal denied, 741 A.2d 195 (Pa. 1992);\u00a0Hunt. v. Pa.\r\nDep\u2019t of Corr., 698 A.2d 147, 149 (Pa. Commw. 1997) (holding that requests,\r\nincluding a request for all documents given by Department of Corrections to\r\ninmate and by inmate to Department, lacked sufficient specificity).  \u00a0  Pennsylvania courts have compared such broad, sweeping requests to discovery-type requests which, while potentially proper in the context of civil litigation, are improper under the RTKL. Berman v. Pa. Convention Ctr. Auth., 901 A.2d 1085, 1089 (Pa. Commw. 2006) (holding that request for \u201c\u2018[t]he most recent plans, construction, and design documents\u2019 relating to\u201d the convention center expansion was \u201cmore in the nature of a discovery request than a proper request for public records\u201d); Associated\r\nBuilders and Contractors, Inc. v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Gen Servs., 747 A.2d 962, 965-66 (Pa. Commw. 2000) (holding that requests \u201cakin to document requests under the civil discovery rules, i.e., \u2018any and all documents relating to [subject matter]\u2019\u201d lack sufficient specificity); accord PSP v. OOR, 995\r\nA.2d. 515, 517 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (\u201cThe portion of the request seeking any and\r\nall records, files or communications [concerning subject matter] is\r\ninsufficiently specific for the PSP to respond to the request.\u201d). Such broad\r\nrequests have been, and will be, denied.  \u00a0  It would place an unreasonable burden on the City to go through all of its records for an extended period of time without knowing, with sufficient specificity, what type of records are being sought. Cf. Mollick v. Twp. of Worcester, 32\r\nA.3d 859, 871 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2011) (holding that requests seeking emails\r\nbetween certain agency officials and employees for the past one and five years\r\nwithout sufficiently identifying the subject matter were insufficiently\r\nspecific, and concluding that \u201cit would place an unreasonable burden on an\r\nagency to examine all its emails for an extended time period without knowing,\r\nwith sufficient specificity, what Township business or activity the request is\r\nrelated [to].\u201d) \u200b       This correspondence will close your request with our office as permitted by law.  Respectfully,     Feige\r\nM. Grundman  Pronouns:\r\nshe/her  \u00a0  Chief Deputy City Solicitor  Right to Know Unit  City\r\nof Philadelphia Law Department  One Parkway Building, 17th Floor  1515 Arch Street  Philadelphia, PA 19102   \u00a0  *Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.101 et seq. In accordance with RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires use of the standard statewide Right to Know Form for the submission of written requests pursuant to RTKL (\u201cRTK Requests\u201d). See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file an RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Commw. 2012). This policy is available online at https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/ To the extent you intended to submit an RTK Request, your request is denied as you have not complied with the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a RTK Request pursuant to RTKL and has processed it as an informal\u00a0request. The City nonetheless referred to RTKL for guidance in determining whether records should be released in response to your request.     ** This language is identical to the sufficient specificity requirement in \u00a7 2(c) of the prior Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. 66.1, et seq. Accordingly, the case law interpreting this language in the context of the old Right-to-Know Law remains binding. Dep't of Conservation & Natural Res. v. Office of Open Records, 1 A.3d 929, 940-41 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (interpreting language in the new Act by relying on prior precedent holding that \u201c[t]he language in the two definitions is virtually identical. Faced with a prior judicial interpretation . . . .by . . . the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of the account/voucher/contract language in the RTKL, even though issued in the context of the Old Law, we are not at liberty here to ascribe a different meaning to the same language.\u201d).\u00a0    \r\n                           \r\n                            On\r\n                            Tue, May 21 at  4:08 PM\r\n                            ,  City of Philadelphia Right to Know <righttoknow@phila.gov>  wrote:\r\n                             THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA     Dear 164074-30279347@requests. muckrock. com,     Thank you for your correspondence. This is an automatic response to let you know that the City will process your request and respond further within five business days of its receipt by an Open Records Officer.

FOIA Advisory Committee December 7, 2023 Meeting Persons Present\r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply.\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA.\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 24-A.A . FOIA Advisory Committee December 7, 2023 Meeting Persons Present See PDF.\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords of the FOIA Advisory Committee December 7, 2023 Meeting Participants or persons present, including but not limited to: a) all participants/persons present who registered to participate via WEBEX; b) and all NARA support personnel; c) moderator(s).\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request this FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nThe Webex recording link should also be included in the FOIA Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tFOIA Advisory Committee certified meeting minutes must be accurate. If they are not, it is explosive.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public- comments\r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not\r\npaid\tTemporary.

RE_ Immediate FPL Dispute Resolution Freedom of Information Act Request NGC24-130. Records of the FOIA Advisory Committee December 7, 2023 Meeting Participant\r\n\r\nMr. Stern NARA Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Public Liaison (FPL):\r\n\r\nThat is not how FPL dispute resolution works. You should know better. \r\n\r\nYou must address my dispute in its entirety.\r\n\r\nPer my request to you for expedited processing:\r\n\u2022\tI am seeking that NARA address every element and sub-element of my request for expedited processing. NARA must address all elements and to deny expedited processing NARA must reject every element/sub-element.\r\n\u2022\tNARA\u2019s generalized statement, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing your request, we do not believe expedition is warranted, as you have not demonstrated that your request meets the above-referenced criteria\u201d does not comport with law.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOJ OIP Compliance Inquiry and NARA OIG Request for Audit.\r\n\r\nPlease address above and below.\r\n\r\nNARA repeats the exact same wording to every request for expedited processing, never evaluating all elements of such requests. \r\n\r\nNARA has the worst FOIA statistics in the federal government. NARA did not PROCESS any requests for expedited processing in FY 2022 despite claiming to have granted 58 and denied 329. NARA does not show any pending expedited processing requests in queue for FY 2022. \r\n\r\nnara-fy22.pdf (archives.gov) https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nara-fy22.pdf \r\n\r\nVII.A.\r\nVII.B.\r\nVII.C.\r\nVII.D.\r\nVIII.A.\r\n\r\nThere is both internal inconsistency in NARA\u2019s FY 2022 data and inconsistency with its FY 2021 Annual FOIA report.\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/files/foia/reports/nara-fy21-final.pdf \r\n\r\nNARA failed miserably its last FOIA audit in 2017, including then submitting massively false/unreliable FOIA reports. Things have gotten much worse. https://www.archives.gov/files/oig/reports/audit-report-17-AUD-16.pdf \r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s quarterly and Annual FOIA Reports are massively false based on written public comments that I have posted.\r\n\r\nNARA cannot again submit for FY 2023 a materially false Annual FOIA report, nor can DOJ OIP accept such a knowingly false annual FOIA report based on written public comments alone. (See public comments list attached.).\r\n\r\nA NARA OIG audit of FOIA funding and compliance is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nFYSA regarding model determination letters and the requirement to articulate the specific reason for any denial. See PDF attached regarding NARA\u2019s impermissible pattern of practice for all expedited processing denials.\r\n\r\nNARA denied my request for expedited processing within minutes of purportedly receiving my request. \r\n\r\nRecords sought concern the FOIA Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert  (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Gary Stern <garym.stern@nara.gov> \r\nSent: Thursday, January 25, 2024 11:18 AM\r\nTo: perseverance2013@aol.com\r\nCc: ngc.foia.liaison@nara.gov; foia@nara.gov; joseph.a.scanlon@nara.gov; joseph.scanlon@nara.gov; archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov; execsec@nara.gov\r\nSubject: Re: Immediate FPL Dispute Resolution Freedom of Information Act Request NGC24-130.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the IN APRA, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including MuckRock, the Invisible Institute and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe request any spreadsheets, logs, data, or other similar documents maintained by ILEA sufficient to show the following information regarding law enforcement officers who receive basic training waivers in IN due to their previous certification in other states. Specifically, please provide as many of the following data points as are maintained:\r\n\r\n- Unique ID\r\n- Name\r\n- Previous state that the officer was previously certified by\r\n- Date of IN certification\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nInvisible Institute",

Prior to January 1, 2024, there were not certificates of completion that were generated, they just graduated, and that entry was made in each officer\u2019s file. This makes it difficult to run a report searching for waiver certificates, which would have been the easier report.\r\n\r\nI was able to run a report of officers who have been admitted into the waiver course, which does not always ensure graduation, and does not automatically tell me the date of completion of the course.
