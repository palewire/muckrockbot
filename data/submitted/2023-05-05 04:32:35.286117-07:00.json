These records would be within the Department's Subject Matter List, headings \"Mental Health & Drug/Alcohol Surveillance & Programs\" and \"Poison Control Center.\"\r\n\r\nThe specific quote by the Mayor about children is that \"they start their day going to the corner bodega, buying cannabis and fentanyl.\" See @theRecount. 2023. \u201c\u2018[Kids] Start Their Day Going to the Corner Bodega, Buying Cannabis and Fentanyl ... They Look at TikTok, That\u2019s Teaching Them How to Steal Cars.\u2019 \u2014 NYC Mayor Eric Adams (D) Echoes GOP Talking Points While Speaking at the National Day of Prayer Conference\".\u201d Twitter. May 4, 2023. https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1654198878781034502.\r\n\r\nShould there exist any record that an actual child in New York City has started their day, specifically purchasing with a cannabis product contaminated with fentanyl, please only provide that record. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of such a specific record, I request any and all records of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with regard to *any* part of the claim, regardless of whether it is actual or merely rumored, so long as it involves cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl.  That is, any and all records that fit the following bullet point descriptions should be treated as responsive:\r\n\r\n* Records mentioning, describing, or pertaining to the existence (actual or merely rumored) of cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl;\r\n* Records mentioning, describing, or pertaining to the existence (actual or merely rumored) of cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl that are possessed or available for purchase;\r\n* Records mentioning, describing, or pertaining to the existence (actual or merely rumored) of cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl that are possessed or available for purchase by children;\r\n* Records mentioning, describing, or pertaining to the existence (actual or merely rumored) of cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl that are possessed or available for purchase in New York City;\r\n* Records mentioning, describing, or pertaining to the existence (actual or merely rumored) of cannabis products contaminated with fentanyl that are possessed or available for purchase in New York City by children. \r\n\r\nPlease note: in a February 2023 press conference, the Mayor specifically authorized the speedy public release of information about this claim, as quoted here: \"We'll give a list of what we are finding and what they are mixed with, if it is fentanyl or others. So I'll have the N.Y.P.D. give a list of what we're finding in it. We'll get that to you today.\" (see \u201cTranscript: Mayor Eric Adams Announces Joint Efforts to Combat Proliferation of Illegal, Unlicensed Cannabis Dispensaries.\u201d 2023. The Official Website of the City of New York. February 2023. https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/096-23/transcript-mayor-eric-adams-joint-efforts-combat-proliferation-illegal-unlicensed.)\r\n\r\nAs the Mayor specifically alludes to evidence of his claims and specifically authorizes its release, there are no grounds for citing public safety exemptions to FOIL in withholding a record such as law enforcement secrecy or ongoing investigation. Please note that the a document marked\"For Official Use Only\" has no special classified status under the law and should be released.  \r\n\r\nDisclosure of these records will serve the public interest of avoiding bodegas selling cannabis with fentanyl contamination, evaluating the truth of statements regarding fentanyl and understanding the current state of the War on Drugs. This public good should be evaluated before the withholding of documents or redaction citing privacy interests. \r\n\r\nUnder New York State FOIL, wrongful withholding of information may give rise to a lawsuit under Article 78 proceeding in which the agency will be expected to pay reasonable attorney's fees to gain its compliance with the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

This case is of great public interest as it involved the wrongful convictions of five teenagers - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise - for the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a female jogger, in Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. The case garnered significant media attention and raised serious concerns about the criminal justice system, police tactics, and racial bias. The convictions were later vacated in 2002, and a settlement was reached with the City of New York in 2014.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking the following records:\r\n\r\nAll internal memos, emails, and communications related to the investigation of the Central Park Five case.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise, including but not limited to police reports, witness statements, interrogation records, and forensic evidence.\r\nAll records of any internal investigations, disciplinary actions, or reviews related to the handling of the Central Park Five case, including any assessments or evaluations of the tactics employed during the investigation and interrogation process.\r\nAny documents or records that detail the settlement and/or restitution process for Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation and prosecution of Matias Reyes, whose confession and DNA evidence ultimately led to the exoneration of the Central Park Five.\r\nAny other relevant documents, records, or files that pertain to the Central Park Five case.\r\nI request that you provide these records without redaction or withholding, as the requested documents are of significant public interest and concern. If any information is withheld or redacted, please provide a written explanation for the denial, citing the specific exemption(s) under FOIL that justify the withholding or redaction. As established in numerous FOIL cases, including Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Department (89 N.Y.2d 267) and Matter of Fink v. Lefkowitz (47 N.Y.2d 567), the burden of proof for denying access to requested documents falls on the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that I intend to exhaust all administrative remedies and may seek judicial review under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules if access to the requested documents is denied or if there is an unreasonable delay in providing the requested documents.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need clarification regarding this request, please   feel free to reach out  for clarfication\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request all the data and documents reviewed and utilized by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in preparing Table 2 of the report titled \"ICE Faces Barriers in Timely Repatriation of Detained Aliens\" and dated March 11, 2019. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-03/OIG-19-28-Mar19.pdf \r\n\r\nThe report includes a \"case review of 3,053 aliens not removed within 90 days of receiving a final order of removal,\" based on a snapshot of case dispositions as of March 24, 2018. On page 28, in Appendix C, \"Results of Electronic File Case Review,\" there is a table titled \"Table 2: Snapshot Case Dispositions.\" The source for Table 2 is identified as: \u201cOIG Analysis of Aliens Detained Longer than 90 Days Post Final Order of Removal, from ICE ENFORCE Alien Removal Module, ICE Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis case disposition information as of March 24, 2018.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request all the \"case disposition information\" from the \"Aliens Detained Longer than 90 Days Post Final Order of Removal\" section within the ICE ENFORCE Alien Removal Module, in its original form as provided to OIG for purposes of the report. In addition, I request all documents and/or tables created by OIG in the course of conducting its \"[a]nalysis\" of the aforementioned data.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that ICE waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding in what circumstances ICE will continue to detain non-citizens after 90 days of post-removal order detention. As previously indicated, CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.  \r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations assisting detained non-citizens in similar circumstances. As a provider of legal services to detained non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients. \r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). \r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing: \r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is aware of at least ten individuals who are currently detained by ICE past the 90-day removal period, including four detained after being granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. These individuals need information about ICE\u2019s policies and practices in order to understand the basis for their detention and advocate for their release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",
