Patel as special agent in charge of the New York Area of Responsibility. \r\n\r\nYour request was received in this office on 8/5/2025. \r\n\r\nAfter careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is not reasonably described due to the reason(s) listed below: \r\n\r\n-Your request is too broad in scop, please narrow. \r\n-Your request did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking. \r\nRecords must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, case number, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \r\n\r\n-Clearly identify the subject matter. \r\n-Provide a date range of X-X days/weeks/months/years. \r\n-Identify the specific program office, position titles, or individuals. \r\n-Avoid using general or ambiguous language (e.g. \u201call communications,\u201d \u201ceverything related to,\u201d \u201call records\u201d). \r\n\r\nIf you require assistance to reasonably describe the records you are seeking, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. You have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

Your request was received in this office on 8/5/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182.

You have requested Introductory announcement, prepared remarks, agenda items, and other materials related to the appointment of Ricky J. Patel as special agent in charge of the New York Area of Responsibility \r\n\r\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. HSI \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number.

You have requested Introductory announcement, prepared remarks, agenda items, and other materials related to the appointment of Ricky J. Patel as special agent in charge of the New York Area of Responsibility \n\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \n\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. HSI \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Pepin:\r\n\r\nAlthough you framed your request as an open records request, what you seem to be seeking is for us to collect statistical data. You requested information regarding the Family Member Care Tax Credit including:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Number of returns that claimed the credit\r\n  2.  Total amount of credits claimed ($)\r\n  3.  If available, (1) and (2) separately by taxpayer characteristics, such as filing status, marital status, age of taxpayer, AGI range, number of dependents, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause the purpose of an open records request is to obtain copies of records that already exist, our response to your request as an open records request would be that we have no documents responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were able to collect the data you were seeking. Attached to this email is an Excel document with the information we were able to pull from our system. The credit information is stated by year, amount, and number of claimants, and contains two tables sorting the information by federal AGI and filing status. Please note that the earliest available information is from tax year 2000, and that these totals reflect the actual credit amount claimed on individual income tax returns based on the unique circumstances of each return.\r\n\r\nBased on changes in tax law in 2023, which generally eliminated the payment obligation for the lowest bracket of individual income tax (approximately Federal taxable income of $50,000 and below), there are no credit amounts to report for the period of 2023 through present.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of any further assistance with regard to this request, please reach out to me at mfdanielson@nd.gov<mailto:mfdanielson@nd.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Danielson\r\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General\r\nNORTH DAKOTA OFFICE OF STATE TAX COMMISSIONER\r\n600 E Boulevard Ave., Dept. 127\r\nBismarck, ND 58505-0599\r\nP: 701-328-2781  |  Fax: 701-328-3700  |  nd.gov/tax<http://www.nd.gov/tax>\r\n\n[cid:image001.png@01DC99CC.587764F0]",

I am not sure why your previous requests were not seen until today and apologize for the inconvenience that may have been caused. Your request is for talking points, scripts, and notes used to prepare for the press conference held on April 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe link provided did not work for me, however I located the press release and believe you are referring to the \"RRHA Addresses Lease Enforcement Cases Due to Non-Payment of Rent\" Press Conference held on April 19, 2024 at 10 a.m. Please let me know if I am incorrect.\r\n\r\nUpon further review, a response will be provided to you within 5 business days of your initial request date. Day 1 is considered the day after your request is received. The five-day period does not include weekends or holidays.  If it is not practically possible to identify, locate, or provide the records you requested within 5 business days, RRHA may require an additional 7 business days to respond to your request pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3704(B)(4).\r\n\r\nRRHA reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for searching, duplicating, and supplying the requested records, but the fee shall not exceed the actual costs incurred. You may request an estimate of the cost in advance of receiving the requested records.  All requests received by RRHA are handled pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3700.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want to modify your request or if you have any questions.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nKung Fu Joe \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://www.muckrock.com/respond/2156999/ In accordance with , we are acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the District\u00a0will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request and to locate, assemble, and review the requested records.  RCW 42.56.520 Please note that this request may be subject to applicable fees as permitted by the PRA. RCW 42.56.120. The District\u00a0charges 5 cents for 4 electronic files/or attachments. RCW 42.56.120(2)(b)(iii). We will let you know in advance if there will be a fee and whether, in keeping with RCW 42.56.120(4), a 10% fee deposit will be required before we proceed with your request. Please be aware that, in keeping with our obligations under the Washington Public Records Act (PRA), any information that personally identifies a student (unless the requestor is that student\u2019s parent or guardian) must be redacted from all materials provided in response to a public records request. RCW 42.56.230(1). We ran some preliminary searches to get a sense for the number of potentially responsive emails. A search for emails from/to/cc @wssda.org returned only 8 emails, which have been uploaded here: Public Records Request - R000275-121625  A search for messages from/to/cc \u201cwssda\u201d returned 111,302 messages, many of which were mass mailings relating to news updates. When we ran a search omitting the most common of those bulk messages (using the search terms below), we had 29,840 messages. The applicable fee for that number of messages would be over $350 \u2013 and it seems possible that a large number of those emails might not be of interest to you. We ran that same search just for the period from 12/1/25 to 12/16/25 and had 31 results. We have attached those messages so you can take a look at the types of records the search is pulling up. If you have additional search terms you would like us to use or a specific date range that you would like us to pull first, please let us know. We want to make sure you get what you are interested in without unnecessary expense and without having to slog through records that are of no interest to you. Once we have your direction for a revised search, or your go-ahead to continue with the 29,840-result search, we will provide you with an anticipated fulfillment date and a fee estimate. Please let us know if you have any questions. Sincerely, Sarah Kolpacoff \r\nPublic Records Officer",

My name is Joseph Anderson\u00a0and I am a Deputy Public Records Officer\u00a0for Skamania County. I assist inreviewing and responding to public records requests (PRRs) for alldepartments. \r\n\r\nOn February 03, 2026, I received your public records request as follows: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office, along with accompanying potential impeachment material. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRose Terse \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://www.muckrock.com/respond/2208085/.\" \r\nPlease note that Skamania County does not have a ' Brady List' per se.  There is one (1) deputy that worksfor the Skamania County Sheriff\u2019s Office for whom we have potentialimpeachment information and for whom we provide a memo disclosing and summarizing thecircumstances. We provide this memo when required to defense counsel oncases involving this deputy. Because there is only one (1) local deputy forwhom we maintain potential impeachment disclosure information, there is no list. Just the singlememo, which we are happy to provide [ please see attached]. \r\n\r\nTheWashington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-widepotential impeachment issues with WSP employees. We do not maintain thisinformation in any organized way because it does not apply to anyofficers that regularly appear in our courts/cases. I just want toconfirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extentthat these records are related to WSP employees, are likely bettersought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (inaddition to any lists). After reviewing our files, we have located records that are responsive to your request. Please log in to the Skamania County Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the records responsive to your request: County Public Records Request - C003886-020326\r\nSkamaniaCounty has searched for, attempted to identify, locate, and provide anynon-exempt public records that may be responsive to this request. Since this completely fulfills your request, we are now closing this public records request. The one (1) yearstatute of limitations to seek judicial review under the Public RecordsAct (Chapter 42.56 RCW) begins now because Skamania County does notintend to further address this request. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns by replying to this email or at my phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson \r\nDeputy Public Records Officer \r\nOffice of the Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney \r\n240 NW Vancouver Avenue | PO Box 790 \r\nStevenson, WA 98648 \r\n509-427-3791",

This email is to seek clarification of your request. Our request for clarification is as follows: All Washington Brady-Giglio list, formally known as Potential Impeachment Disclosure (PID) under RCW 10.93.180, are required to be maintained by each individual law enforcement agency and reported to their county\u2019s Prosecuting Attorney Office (PAO) within 10 days of an incident occurring. See RCW 10.93.180: Protocol for potential impeachment disclosures. There are 39 county prosecutors\u2019 offices in Washington, and one of our divisions currently has about eleven lists in their possession but they may be outdated at this current juncture, and we are interpreting your request to be seeking the most up to date list. Nonetheless, we are more than happy to produce the limited materials we have but, if you are looking for the most accurate information available, you may want to contact the county prosecutors\u2019 offices. Please let us know right away, but not later than October 3, 2025, if you wish to receive the approximate 11 lists. In addition, we have the following questions regarding the records you are seeking: 1.  may we apply a timeframe to your request? such as 2025? or the last year? 2.  may we apply a specific law enforcement agency? such as Olympia, WA Police Department or the Thurston County Sheriff's Department? Please let us know right away, but not later than October 3, 2025. If we do not hear from you on or before this date, we will begin producing records in installments as they come available. Please note that installments are provided free of charge via Box for inspection and/or download. You will not need a Box account to access the records. If you have any questions, please contact me via email or at Office of the Attorney General, Public Records & Constituent Services, P.O. Box 40100, Olympia, WA 98504-0100. Thank you.

Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for information, that information is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the information is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request. Within the next ten (10) days, we will determine whether your request seeks copies of disclosable records in the City's possession or whether the City will require an extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCity Clerk's Office\r\n\r\n(831) 768-3048\r\n\r\n275 Main Street, Suite 400, Watsonville, CA 95076\r\n\r\nFAX:&nbsp;831-761-0736\r\n\r\nE-mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;cityclerk@watsonville.gov\r\n\r\nOpen Monday - Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of Watsonville, CA.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://cityofwatsonvilleca.nextrequest.com/settings?id=2537475\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear David Moore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of Watsonville (\u201cCity\u201d) is in receipt of the Public Records Act request you submitted, received on January 26, 2026 (\u201cRequest\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City intends to cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d). (Government Code section 7920.000 et seq.) Under established California law, the City is obliged to comply with a request for a public record so long as the requestor makes a specific and focused request for the record, that record is maintained by the City in its ordinary course of business, the record is disclosable, and the record can be located with reasonable effort. The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions, requests for information, or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe City has determined that it possesses records responsive to your Request. However, the City is withholding the responsive records pursuant to California Civil Code section 1798.90.55(b). (See also Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7927.705.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this letter and production, the City considers this Request complete.

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\nSincerely, Jessica Riley \r\n330-978-8228\r\njlr00026@mix.wvu.edu",

You are seeking any reports from the OIDO office regarding overdoses, uses of force, or rape/sexual assault allegations at the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Philipsburg, PA beginning in January 2023 and continuing through the date the agency tasks an adequate search in response to this request. \r\n\r\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of files within the DHS Privacy Office for records that would be responsive to your request.  Unfortunately, we were unable to locate or identify any responsive records. \r\n\r\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within DHS Privacy Office that would be responsive to your request.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to:  Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2).  Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below who processed your request and refer to 2024-HQFO-01343.  You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge.\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office \r\nDepartment of Homeland Security \r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE \r\nMail Stop 0655 \r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655 \r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov \r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia",

Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of June 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period of June 1, 2024, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the audit data in a structured format such as .csv, .xls, or another machine-readable database filetype.\r\n\r\n3. Data Sharing\r\na. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data\r\nb. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data\r\nc. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information\r\nd. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information\r\n\r\nYou may find that these requests result in a large number of files. These exports from the Flock system are standardized data formats that are inconsequential to redact. To remove private information, simply omit the \"License Plate\" column. We find that other agencies have had trouble with this until they realized they could do this.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the case of any applicable fees, it is requested that an estimate of the total charges be provided prior to fulfilling this request. The preferred method of receipt is through electronic delivery.\r\n\r\nYour assistance and cooperation in this matter are greatly appreciated. A response within 5 business days, as the statute requires is anticipated.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDavid S. (he/him/his), Lucy Parsons Labs",

Specifically, there is no date range provided in this request. Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency. For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\r\n\r\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components. Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions. A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online: https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information. If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office. Otherwise, respond back with your additional information.\r\n\r\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.\r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request. You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-HQFO-01341. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or at 202-343-1743.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia\"",

I do not have any questions regarding this manual, I do however have a public records request related to a section of this document, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"414.6 FEDERAL REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE\r\nRequests by federal immigration officials for assistance from this department should be directed\r\nto a supervisor. The supervisor is responsible for determining whether the requested assistance\r\nwould be permitted under the California Values Act (Government Code \u00a7 7284.2 et seq.).\"\r\n\r\nSpecifically,  I am requesting any document, email, or notification, in possession by the San Luis Obispo Police Department (SLOPD) received from either the US Department of Homeland Security or US Immigration and Customs Enforcement pertaining to their (ICE/DHS) activity in San Luis Obispo city and county on 12/29/2025.\r\n\r\nFurther, I am requesting any document or email from SLOPD responding to or acknowledging the aforementioned document, email, or notification from DHS/ICE  to SLOPD regarding their activity (DHS/ICE) on 12/29/2025.\r\n \r\nLastly, I am requesting the actual FEDERAL REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE to the SLOPD from DHS or any agency thereunder related to their (DHS/ICE) activity in San Luis Obispo city and county on 12/29/2025. \r\n\r\nHaving been surrounded by and detained (in the vernacular, \"jumped\") in the dark on 12/29/2025 in San Luis Obispo at 6:15am for no other reason than being impoverished and living in a rundown apartment complex with a large Hispanic population (also impoverished), by unknown masked individuals, including one one wearing a tactical vest (instead of a red coat) with a \"police\" patch on it without a badge (similar to another era's Gestapo or Stasi) and having not identified which agency's authority they were working under, I, as well as many of my entire state's impoverished Mexican-AMERICAN camarada, find these documents and their ability to turn our local, supine, prostrate, and compliant police departments, into nothing more than an extension of a hostile and insulated federal government located thousands of miles away (similar to England's relationship with America in its colonial past), to be of particular interest. Thank you. \r\n\r\nShawn Harris \r\n\r\n",
