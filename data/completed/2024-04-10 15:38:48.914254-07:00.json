        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Manning,\r\n\r\nWe are processing your request for \"[a]ny FOIA requests to the SEC responded during the month of August 2022, and the responsive documents.\" This request was assigned tracking number 22-02910-FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe need to request clarification of your request in order to identify the information of most interest to you. Are you interested in the response letters for just those requests where records were provided?\r\n\r\nWe respond to a high volume of FOIA requests where there is no information found and no records are provided to the requester. We receive between 10,000-13,000 requests per year, so our volume of outgoing final response letters for a single month may be 1,000 letters or more, including only interim and final response letters (not including acknowledgement letters, other types of administrative letters, emails, etc.). Further, these letters are only stored in each individual request file and would require an extensive manual search.\r\n\r\nDepending on the information you are seeking, it might be possible to arrange for an alternative to the letters, such as a list of all requests that were closed during the time period of your request where records were provided.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know at your earliest convenience how you would like you proceed. We will place your request on hold until we hear back, and we would request that you please respond by Wednesday, November 2. We will be happy to work with you to determine the best way to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nCarrie Hyde-Michaels\r\nFOIA Branch Chief\r\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\nhyde-michaelsc@sec.gov<mailto:hyde-michaelsc@sec.gov>\r\nDirect: (202) 551-5816",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. \r\n2. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff. Please provide a quantitative list of the time involved and the staff who performed the tasks.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Gov't Code, which provides that an e-mail address of a member of the public that is provided for the purpose of communicating electronically with a governmental body is confidential and not subject to disclosure.  Additional redactions have been made per The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), where a student's identifying information appears within the records.\r\n\r\nSection 552.275 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a governmental body to establish a reasonable limit, not less than 15 hours for a one month period or 36 hours in a 12 month period, on the amount of time that personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies to a requestor, without recovering the costs attributable to the personnel time related to that requestor. Section 552.275 does not replace or supersede other sections, and it does not preclude a governmental body from charging labor for a request for inspection or copies for which a charge is authorized under other sections of this law.\r\n\r\nKeller ISD has established 15 hours in a one-month period and 36 hours per 12-month period as the reasonable limit on the amount of time personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies without recovering attributable costs. This 12-month period coincides with the District's fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Requestors who exceed the 36-hour time limit in a fiscal year (or 15 hours in one month) shall pay all costs attributable to cost of materials, personnel time, and overhead expenses necessary to comply with the request, even if the requestor intends to only inspect the documents.  For the 2023-2024 fiscal year thus far, the District has spent 1.0 hour(s) responding to requests you have submitted to date (since July 1, 2023) and provided you with the records gathered and compiled as a result.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the District's response to the March 13, 2024 request.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nKeller ISD Public Records\r\nP: 817-744-1000 | F: 817-744-1263\r\nwww.kellerisd.net<http://www.kellerisd.net/>",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to the Fontana Police Department\u2019s purchase, usage, and policies regarding cellular communications interception technology (CCIT) and cell site simulators (CSS).\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2023, the Fontana City Council approved the purchase of the Jacobs Technology Inc. Rapid Solutions system, which included the purchase and installation of a Base Station System for $920,098.94. The Rapid Solutions system qualifies as a CCIT and CSS. This purchase follows the acquisition of the Keyw CCIT/CSS systems; Keyw was acquired by Jacobs in 2019.\r\n\r\n1. Fontana Police Department's CCIT/CSS usage and privacy policy regarding the collection, use, maintenance, data retention, sharing, and dissemination of information, including all directives, bulletins, memoranda and related guidance;\r\n2. All memoranda of understanding or other agreements with other local agencies or any other party for the shared use of CCIT/CSS or the sharing of information collected through its use;\r\n3. All policies, guidance, training materials or other documents regarding the use of CCIT/CSS and compliance with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA); \r\n4. All disclosures to the California Department of Justice regarding CCIT/CSS use as required by CalECPA; \r\n5. All emails, documents, user manuals, marketing materials, presentations and other documentation describing the following Jacobs products: \r\n    a. Base Station NG;\r\n    b. Trachea2+;\r\n    c. Jugular4+;\r\n    d. Light Embedded Software System;\r\n6. All CCIT/CSS deployment logs from April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024;\r\n7. All search warrants filed in relation to the use of CCIT/CSS from the period April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024. \r\n\r\nIn addition we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n* Assistance in identifying additional records and information that describes Fontana\u2019s usage, acquisition of, and policies related to CCIT and CSS;\r\n* A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n* Suggestion for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at this email address. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWill Greenberg\r\nStaff Technologist\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Be advised, City of Chicago Employee email addresses, hospital names and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

An unforeseen circumstance arose during the course of our review process that the office of record informed and presented to us new information belonging to other entities that they had overlooked in their initial submission to our office.  This offset our previous endeavors to ensuring accuracy and our requirement to oversight in protecting any associated parties.  Having now incorporated this new information into our hold of responsive documents for this request, we are again proceeding with the review process and will continue to keep you updated with our progress towards fulfillment as soon as we are able.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, Respectfully\r\n\r\nCharles A.

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Mr. Ciaramella,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the CSEMO's FOIA Officer. This email is to acknowledge receipt of, and clarify your FOIA request. CSEMO received your request on October 17, 2023, and assigned it FOIA Tracking Number 24-00039-F. Please refer to this number when communicating with the VA about this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther clarification is needed before we can process your request. According to our regulations, a request for records \"must contain a reasonable description of the records desired so that it may be located with relative ease.\" Per 38 CFR, 1.554(d), the requester's description of the records sought needs to describe such records in enough detail to allow VA FOIA Officers to locate them with a \"reasonable amount of effort.\" To the extent possible, the requester should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient and subject matter. Wide ranging requests that lack specificity or contain descriptions of very general subject matters with no description of specific records may be considered \"not reasonably described.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   All email addressed associated with any current political appointees, including alternate and pseudonymous accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarification Needed: Please provide the information below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *    Are you requesting a list of email addresses for all political appointees, including alternate and pseudonymous accounts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We appreciate your interest in the VA.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Ernesto Cardenal.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

To achieve that, I would like the following information:\r\n- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS, filtered to table(s) that contain ATL 311 cases\r\n- Data Dictionary (i.e. column descriptions + context on what they're used for)\r\n\r\nUntil I have the above metadata, I'm not sure what is available for 311 cases, so here is a list of fields I need:\r\n- Creation Date (when the ATL 311 request was submitted)\r\n- Request Description\r\n- Location (feel free to provide whatever fields apply to this: cross-streets, address, lat/lon, etc)\r\n- Case #\r\n- Disposition (acknowledged, rejected...whatever final state the case ended up in)\r\n\r\nTime range: 2017 through present day (March 31, 2024)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The NSA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Privacy Act (PA) divison treats all FOIA and PA requesters fairly by responding to each on a first-in, first-out basis in accordance with federal regulations.  Each request is unique; as such, there is no set timeframe for this process.  Each case that has responsive records goes through three levels of review prior to the final response.  The length of review in each phase depends on many factors, such as the number of pages and classification level.\r\nPlease be advised that there are a significant number of FOIA requests ahead of yours in the FOIA backlog queue, such that we are unable to provide an estimated date of first level review at this time.  A letter will be sent from the NSA FOIA/PA division once a case moves to the next phase of processing.\r\nNSA Freedom of Information Division\r\n(301) 688-6527\n",

At this time, production work related to your public records request remains underway, and it is not possible to estimate how much longer that work may take.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records Law, Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 19.31 to 19.39, authorizes requesters to inspect or obtain copies of \u201crecords\u201d created or maintained by an \u201cauthority.\u201d Records are presumed to be open to public inspection and copying, but there are exceptions. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.31. Statutes, the common law, and the public records law balancing test, which weighs the public interest in disclosure of a record against the public interest in nondisclosure, provide such exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhen DOJ receives a public records request, DOJ must search to identify responsive records. Once records are located, DOJ must review each record to determine if all or part of the record cannot be disclosed pursuant to statute, the common law, or the balancing test. This process can take substantial time to complete, especially for complex files or records.\r\n\r\nDOJ receives a high volume of public records requests and, to the extent possible, works to process them in the order in which they are received. Presently, we have a large number of requests received prior to yours that remain in progress, too.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that DOJ continues to process your request.

These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Adam,\r\n\r\nThank you for narrowing the scope of your previous request.\r\nSince it appears you have not limited the 38 years of documentation you have requested, we will need additional time to gather the older documents.\r\nWe have identified payroll and other supplemental documents that contain information responsive to your request: QSS and Escape Payroll documents, and supplemental documents that contain employees' position titles. Because payroll information contains protected employee information such as social security number, it will take us additional time to redact or remove the protected information from the responsive documents.\r\nAccordingly, we estimate it will take approximately 45 to 60 days to produce the documents to you for years 2009-2022.\r\nWe estimate it will take approximately 6 to 9 months to find and produce archived documents that would be responsive to the part of your request that includes years 1984-2009.\r\nPlease confirm if you still want to receive documents from 1984-2009 within that time frame.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRose\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D98253.C2F73E60]\r\nRose Bell\r\nDirector of Community Relations and Communications\r\nPronouns: she/her\r\nA guest on traditional Pomo land\r\nO: 707-468-3012\r\n1000 Hensley Creek Rd. | Ukiah, CA 95482\r\nA proud Hispanic-Serving Institution\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D98253.C2F73E60]<https://www.instagram.com/mendocinoeagles/?hl=en>  [cid:image003.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.facebook.com/MendocinoCollege/>   [cid:image004.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://twitter.com/MendocinoEagles>   [cid:image005.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.youtube.com/user/mendocinocollege/featured>   [cid:image006.png@01D98253.C2F73E60] <https://www.linkedin.com/school/mendocino-college/>\n",

        "communication": "At the February 27, 2024 Oak Park Public Library board meeting, a community member made a public comment regarding inconsistent treatment for a FOIA request [1]. Nearly identical requests were made but the responsive records were heavily redacted only for one person.\r\n\r\nIn our FOIA on March 5th [2] and March 8th [3] we saw inconsistency in the FOIA process validating community concerns.\r\n\r\nOn March 16th The Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees published a statement [4] promising:\r\n\r\n\u201cAn analysis of the Library\u2019s FOIA policy and current practices to affirm that they are consistent and responsive.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the The Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees meeting on Tuesday March 26th [5], board President Matthew Fruth apparently reported the results of the analysis:\r\n\r\n(paraphrased from audio transcription)\r\n\u201cI want to make a quick comment about some of the FOIA questions recently. I received, one of co-acting interim director Suzy Wulf, myself, and trusty Ganguly about the handling of some of the the FOIA request in question and informed us that the the one that was not redacted was the one that was provided and and reviewed by her and the one that was redacted was one that she had questions about and referred to our attorney, and the attorney provided those redactions in response to the FOIA in question. I want to make sure that it's very clear that those redactions were done by our Council and not by Miss Wulf. She followed our procedures and was acting in best accordance with the first FOIA that came across her desk and then did what she thought was responsible and forwarded to our attorney a second that was received later for them to review and they provided those redactions. So I would like to make sure that that is out there and hopefully to put that question to rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn March 27th the Wednesday Journal reported [6]:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother incident that may be under investigation is the library\u2019s distribution of FOIA request responses. Two residents submitted FOIA requests asking for the same information. One came back with little to no redactions, and the other had many. \r\n\r\nFoss said the FOIA that was not redacted was reviewed and provided by Wulf. The one that was redacted was one Wulf \u201chad questions about,\u201d he said, and an attorney provided redactions, not Wulf. \r\n\r\n\u201cShe followed our procedures and was acting in best accordance with the first FOIA that came across her desk,\u201d he said. \u201c[She] did what she thought was responsible and forwarded to our attorney a second [FOIA].\u201d \r\n\r\nThat still does not address concerns regarding why two nearly identical requests were treated differently. To that effect we hereby request the following records pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.:\r\n\r\n***Any and all communication records (including but not limited to hard-copy documents, memos, emails, word processor documents, PDF documents, etc.) generated between January 1, 2024 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) sent between Oak Park Public Library staff Suzanne Wulf and any attorney of Oak Park Public Library.***\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNiles Coalition\r\n\r\n\r\nCITATIONS\r\n[1] OakParkPublicLibrary Youtube video: \u201cBoard of Library Trustees Regular Meeting: February 27, 2024, part 1\u201d <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtRSjF2ihHw&t=1926s>\r\n\r\n[2] Niles Coalition FOIA on Muckrock: OPPL FOIA Logs 2023-2_2024 <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/oak-park-il-5511/oppl-foia-logs-2023-2_2024-159840/>\r\n\r\n[3] Niles Coalition FOIA on Muckrock: OPPL FOIA Response Docs 2023-2_2024 <https://www.muckrock.com/foi/oak-park-il-5511/oppl-foia-response-docs-2023-2_2024-16005>\r\n\r\n[4] Webpage published on oppl.org: \u201cAn Important Message from the Oak Park Public Library Board of Trustees\u201d <https://web.archive.org/web/20240322094159/https://www.oppl.org/news-events/announcements/an-important-message-from-the-oak-park-public-library-board-of-trustees/>\r\n\r\n[5] OakParkPublicLibrary Youtube video \u201cBoard of Library Trustees Regular Meeting March 26, 2024\u201d <https://youtu.be/AHWLWmauu2E?t=1783>\r\n\r\n[6] Wednesday Journal: \u201cOak Park library board begins search for executive director\u201d <https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.oakpark.com/2024/03/27/oak-park-library-executive-director-search/>",

I can see in the first document sent it mentions these conditions are provided to the individual to be supervised, but the policy doesn't appear to list the conditions. If you have a sample copy of those conditions of probation, this is what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nWendy",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional 36 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (the original requester was the parent of the student whose education record it was).

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and you requested production of electronic records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a third installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional two of the public records requests received in 2021, and ten of the public records requests received in 2020, as well as the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and one request contains an OML video file that requires a special software to play, which we are also providing to you in order to view it. For security purposes, we are unable to upload those files to create a shareable link. Therefore, this installment of records has been placed onto a USB drive and is being mailed to you today via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the USB is addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 9405 5036 9930 0196 9827 76<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=9405%205036%209930%200196%209827%2076> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before April 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D83ACB.05C41BE0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. The detailed redaction/exemption logs, as they were provided to the original requester, are included.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a sixth installment of records available for you. These records represent 1 public records request received in 2021 and 5 public records requests received in 2020, and the district responses to those requests. Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s name and other identifying information have been redacted and replaced with initials to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. In addition, a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB). The original requester was the parent of the student whose education record was requested, and the requester later abandoned her request, so there are no records to provide for that request. An Exemption Log for the record withheld is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nThese records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\n[\u200bFolder icon]  Public Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/EqLtqvADXLBPoYP-qpasd8oBkxzNwzy4hOnz7KRsdHZCLg?e=hmhiWL>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by August 28, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, if receipt of the current installment is confirmed by the aforementioned deadline, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before September 2, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D8A28D.B86A91F0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn response to your request, you were notified of our district\u2019s practices, and your obligation as the requester to review or claim your records, on the following dates:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we seek the following clarifications of your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The appears to be a follow up to your most recent request which had a date range of January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Your renewed request reverted back to the initial date range ending November 4, 2021. Please clarify and confirm the date range of your request. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with the date range provided in your request today, for records between January 1, 2010, through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  In your former request for records, received by the district on October 9, 2023, you noted that \"Installments of Records previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Please clarify if this statement remains true, or if you would like us to produce installments previously provided to you again. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with your request as worded, and will reproduce any records responsive to this request that may have previously been provided. Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

Based on the language used in that email it is unclear if this was intended to be a clarification of the March 19, 2024, request or if it was intended to be a new request for records.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we consider this to be a new request for records, as the date range extends beyond the date of the previous March 19, 2024, request, and the link you have included for us to upload records is different than the link provided for the March 19, 2024, request. If you intended for your email clarify your March 19, 2024, request, or if you intended for this new request to replace the March 19, 2024, request, please let us know. Otherwise, we will move forward with both requests respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this request, you have asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 17, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 30, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for you to claim future installments of records and prevent further abandonments of your requests moving forward, whenever possible we will upload installments of records to you using the link you have provided for this request.\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Feverett-public-schools-district-29079%252Feverett-public-schools-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2010-2021-120970%252F%253Femail%253DPublicRecords%252540everettsd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh7OGhIjD3G3hthbXF_zOl4rI%3A1rne10%3AM10-zV4YF_dmLfUXiw4O8SOKj6lRHZzP8a9MqfnKtIo\r\n\r\nIf an alternate method to provide records is necessary, we will notify you that the records will be provided in another method, likely to be placed on a USB and mailed to the address provided:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have concluded processing this request and have the responsive records available for you. These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. If you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA86BB.0CDDA6B0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.
