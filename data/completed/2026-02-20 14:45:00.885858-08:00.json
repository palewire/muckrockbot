The City of Columbus is taking the sanitary sewer (copied on this reply). To date, we have not received water line plans from Verdantas for their proposed public water line work along Airbase Rd. We have, however, attached a related public water line project that will eventually connect to the Verdantas project that you cite.

Except as expressly noted below, it is the City\u2019s intent to cooperate with you in identifying any records that would be responsive to your request, and to expeditiously provide you with those records. However, as you may be aware, under California Law, a request for documents must reasonably describe an identifiable record, and must be focused and specific. (See Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.530(a); Rogers v. Superior Court , 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 481.) Likewise, cities are not required to create a new record in response to a request. (See Haynie v. Superior Court , 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.) Nevertheless, the City will use its best efforts to identify all records that may be responsive to your requests. As you may have anticipated , we will be withholding and/or redacting any writings that consists of records of investigations conducted by the Police Department that are exempt from disclosure pursuant to California Government Code Section 7923.600(a). In response to your request for item 3a- you can obtain this information by visiting our transparency portal at\u00a0https://transparency.flocksafety.com/campbell-ca-pd Due to the need to search and collect a large volume of records for item #1 and Item #2 and Item #3b, I will require an additional 14 days to respond to your request.

We are experiencing challenges in providing the information requested for item #2 due to the volume of records generated each month and the file\u2011size limitations that prevent us from opening them. For context, each month\u2019s record contains more than 90,000 results. At this time, we do not have a method to produce these records. Accordingly, with the records released for item #1, we have provided all responsive documents pertaining to your request, and the matter is considered closed. For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email. Sincerely, Mihui Cho \r\nPolice Department",

Below is a description of the request you made: \r\n  \r\n Name(s) of involved person(s): \r\n  \r\n Name of client (if applicable):\r\n\r\nReport number:\r\n\r\nDescription of public record(s): I hereby request the following records: Records related to the department\u2019s Flock Safety system: 1. Organization Audit in Flock. The report should include data logged from the period of January 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. 2. Network Audit in Flock. The report should include data logged from the period of January 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. 3. A list of network share settings that include: 3a. Flock networks shared with me 3b. Networks that I\u2019m sharing Please provide records in their original electronic, machine readable format. For example, please provide csv or spreadsheet files where applicable.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary search of departmental records, we located twelve (12) organizational audits, and one (1) shared network list. No network audits were located. \r\n  \r\n Your request is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as to any exemptions that may apply. There will be a significant amount of employee time that must be expended, in order to search for and compile documents that comply with your request as well as reviewing the documents for relevancy and redaction of the records. MCL 15.234(8) permits a public body to \u201crequire at the time a request is made a good-faith deposit from the person requesting information . . . if the entire fee estimate or charge authorized [by the statute] exceeds $50.00, based on a good-faith calculation of the total fee\u2026. [T]he deposit shall not exceed \u00bd of the total estimated fee\u2026.\u201d \r\n  \r\n To view and pay your invoice, please click the following link: Request Number: PD-2026-5. The invoice is also attached to this response. The amount listed on this invoice has been adjusted to reflect a 50% deposit of the total estimated costs. The current amount due is $1963.80. You will be responsible for any remaining balance once the fulfillment process is completed. \r\n  \r\n Please be advised that pursuant to MCL 15.234(14) we will consider the request abandoned and will no longer be required to fulfil your request if the deposit is not received within forty-eight (48) days after this correspondence has been sent by our office or you have not filed an appeal of the deposit amount pursuant to section 10a. Once this office receives your deposit, your request will be placed into a queue to be fulfilled. Due to the amount of FOIA requests we\u2019re currently processing, it is estimated that once deposit payment is received, it will take six to eight (6-8) months until you receive the final invoice and/or records. You will be responsible for any remaining balance once the fulfillment process is completed. \r\n  \r\n If you wish to amend your request to change the records you wish to receive, you will need to do so by filing a new FOIA at the following link: https://url4102.request.justfoia.com/ls/click?upn=u001.nrfdmL-2B1UhWpB4V2ArB2sdB-2B6kzx5xZDTE6YDr2ENJxH6yxceD516ltasGiG-2B4brN82O7vDwiPKY5eZhlH7ky6ibfwkf1Ko5LxJk3jNnBjacxt2MIE5NGd1VR9NBvelBRwS__1WF8FJOw6CM0UVLRF29uH0xoLqKtZA39HRyfmuAV9Rz6lU9goPlwIeWajfpm3b2JsswvcaF5LTKBXEt1SarMhP1tsFvQowR4hLvpe0tsNHkAQb0xtibM4Z-2FOdAoBy5YsPgQ-2BeWUCRFTxWJIklYomkEkqyOxlpJhDtVB74X6RZnslo9nhX50Pl-2FIrCzv3GFLbRnGvOZfWIUNPSHiF8Q5qzd8MwJsn1cQ8kUEryVPZgkrXeiWyWokmKYpIxfZdPbd3iRfMDnsOq7qmfX-2BrYMTxfaUQp-2Fr48CiaxV5-2FP3jNugR4hoPbsFkiBGOOuBRlpWhc \r\n  \r\n A copy of the City of Grand Rapids FOIA policy, including your right to appeal, is enclosed.

The name of the employer.\r\n2. The total number of the employer's workers who are currently receiving SNAP benefits.\r\n3. The time period this data covers (e.g., the most recent quarter or year for which data is available).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Any memos, emails, or internal communications from agency leadership discussing or promoting the strategy to issue tickets solely on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\n2. Statistical data or reports that outline traffic enforcement activities, including the number of tickets issued on Wednesdays compared to other days of the week.\r\n\r\n3. Any relevant guidelines or policies that mandate or suggest certain days for traffic enforcement over others.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the objectives behind this strategy and whether any analysis was conducted before its implementation.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee waiver for this request based on the public interest in transparency around law enforcement practices. This information is crucial for understanding how these policies may impact public safety and the fair application of traffic laws.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Subject: Follow-up FOIA Request for Information Regarding Traffic Enforcement Policies and Operational Readiness Deployments (ORD)\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a follow-up request pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, building upon my previous request, #26-385, to which I received a response from Captain Perchard on 01/28/2026.  I acknowledge receipt and review of the provided emails and attached documents, including the Operational Readiness Program 2025 Annual Review and various monthly ORD memos.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Perchard's response indicated that the Weymouth Police Department does not maintain compiled data regarding citation issuance by day of the week and also that there is no requirement to issue citations during Operational Readiness Deployments (ORD), the provided materials did include statistics related to increased traffic stops during these deployments.  My analysis of these documents has raised further questions regarding the program's impact, objectives, and associated metrics.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting the following additional records and information:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  **Funding and Budgetary Impact of Calls for Service Data:**\r\n    \r\n*   All documents, reports, or communications that describe how the Weymouth Police Department utilizes \"calls for service\" data, including yearly call volume projections, for budgetary requests, staffing justifications, or seeking increased funding.\r\n *   Any presentations, meeting minutes, or memoranda prepared for or presented to finance committees or other municipal bodies, where calls for service data was used to support requests for budget items or additional police officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Policies and Information Regarding Performance Metrics and Justification for Non-Patrol Personnel Roles (When Not on ORD):**\r\n    *   Please provide all policies, guidelines, or internal communications that describe the performance metrics used to evaluate the regular duties and contributions of non-patrol personnel (e.g., members of command staff, supervisors, detectives, and officers regularly assigned to administrative functions) when they are *not* deployed on Operational Readiness.\r\n    *   We also request any documentation or analysis that justifies the *established need* for these non-patrol personnel in their standard roles, including how their specific functions contribute to department objectives and overall public safety outside of ORD deployments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  **Detailed Activity Breakdown for a Specific Week:**\r\n \r\n*   Despite the previous statement that compiled data on daily citation issuance is not maintained which I find not credible I request records that would allow for a breakdown of enforcement activities.  Specifically at this time only for the week of **December 14th, 2025 to December 20th, 2025**, please provide:\r\n*   The total number of citations issued.\r\n*   The total number of warrants serviced.\r\n*   The total number of field interviews conducted.\r\n*   *Please provide this breakdown for each day within the specified week:*\r\n            *   Sunday, December 14th, 2025\r\n            *   Monday, December 15th, 2025\r\n            *   Tuesday, December 16th, 2025\r\n            *   Wednesday, December 17th, 2025\r\n            *   Thursday, December 18th, 2025\r\n            *   Friday, December 19th, 2025\r\n            *   Saturday, December 20th, 2025\r\n *   I understand that the department may not explicitly track \"citations issued by day of the week\" as a pre-compiled report. However, I believe individual records of these actions exist and can be compiled for this specific period to provide the requested data which is essential for understanding enforcement patterns.\r\n\r\n4.  **Additional Metrics and Data Related to ORD Deployments:**\r\n    *   Any reports/analyses, or data comparing \"use of force\" incidents that occur during ORD deployment days versus non-ORD deployment days.\r\n    *   Any records/analysis containing racial profiling data, including demographic information of individuals who are subjected to initiated stops, citations, or use of force during ORD deployments.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee waiver for this request based on the public interest in transparency around law enforcement practices.  This information is crucial for understanding how these policies may impact public safety and the fair application of law.  The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and are not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.",

A former refugee, Ngor was originally from Cambodia.\r\n\r\nNgor was an actor, who won an Academy Award for his role in the 1984 film, \"The Killing Fields,\" about Cambodia's communist extremists, known as the Khmer Rouge. As such, there were concerns that group may have assassinated him on US soil.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his death, Ngor was  considering running for high office in Cambodia, and I request information related to his political ambitions (for the Khmer Nation Party) be included in your disclosure.\r\n\r\nNgor was due to attend a fundraising luncheon, in April 1996,  with President Bill Clinton and  Vice President Al Gore.  Please include relevant documents related to this element of the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requestor,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed your request for \"any and all documents related to the murder of Dr. Haing Samnang Ngor.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Sections 7923.600-7923.625 of the California Government Code, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes, are exempt from disclosure. Should any records be located, 9-1-1 telephone calls, recordings, transcripts, witness statements, logs, crime scene photographs, and video evidence are either investigatory records themselves or properly part of an investigative file and therefore exempt from disclosure. Therefore, we are denying your request. Records may be produced in response to a subpoena or court order with pending litigation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, simply respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI am appealing your decision to reject my FOIA request for Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) files related to the murder of Dr. Haing S. Ngor, on February 25, 1996.\r\n\r\nThe previous rejection of my FOIA request cites the California Government Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, the LAPD has already made this material available to other media organizations, and therefore has no basis to deny them to my production of the investigatory podcast, \u201cWho Killed Haing Ngor?\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am repeating my request for the following material, marked by *** below.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Price of Duty,\u201d Season One; Episode 3, the LAPD has participated in production, or shared evidence, in the following ways: \r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary revolves around an extended interview conducted with the full cooperation of Detective Sergeant John Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department.\r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary was conducted with the full cooperation of with Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum.\r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary features a prominent interview with Detective Ed Yee, and a conversation between him and Detective Sergeant Garcia\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned conversations with Detective Sergeant Garcia and Detective Ed Yee\u2019s and their revelation of and discussions about relevant content of the investigation could not have taken place without the consent of the LAPD.  \r\n\r\nTo Wit: \r\n\r\nAUDIO\r\nDetective Sergeant Garcia and Deputy District Attorney Hum reference the contents of recordings of \u201cprior statements\u201d made by witnesses to police before the trial. \r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of the tape-recordings of \u201cprior statements,\u201d made by police, referenced by Hum and Garcia. \r\n\r\nThe LAPD shared with documentary-makers crime scene photos, including images from inside of the victim's vehicle; images of spent shell casings; pages from the Coroner's report; and diagrams from the crime scene.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of crime scene photos, including but not limited to those shared with documentary-makers, in preparation for their production. (This request includes those photographs shown to the producers of the documentary for selection of inclusion in their production, not limited to only those televised.) \r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance in which investigative file contents were shared with the media. \r\n\r\nThese photos were also shared with media in \u201cThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor,\u201d a documentary produced in 2015 by Arthur Dong, of Deep Focus Productions, Inc.\r\n\r\nDuring this documentary, crime scene photographs were shared with the production team, \r\nincluding those depicting Ngor\u2019s body at rest; and exteriors and interiors of Ngor\u2019s apartment, and other photographs depicting evidence and police activities. \r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of all investigative file documents and photographs provided to producers for review for inclusion in their documentary.\r\n\r\nI have reached out both production companies with regards to what documents and photographs they were provided access to in the making of their films. However, I have yet to hear back. \r\n \r\nINTERVIEW GRANTED TO MEDIA\r\nIn 2024, Detective Ed Yee gave an on the record interview to Los Angeles-based production company, Western Sound, for their \u201cStrangeland \u2013 Killing Fields of LA\u201d podcast on the Ngor murder. \r\n\r\nAmong other investigative revelations Detective Ed Yee discussed, he also said, \"I had friends that lived right next door to Haing Ngor or lived across the street from Haing Ngor\" at the time of Ngor's murder. \r\n\r\nThis information was corroborated to me by a third party, known to me.\r\n\r\n*** Therefore, I request all notes and reports related to Detective Ed Yee\u2019s interviewing of those people and whether they identified any of the three defendants as possible suspects; and any written disclosures by Yee of his relationship with any of the potential witnesses.\r\n\r\n*** Based on Detective Yee\u2019s candid revelation of his participation in this investigation during a podcast interview, I would like access to all of Detective Yee\u2019s notes and reports. \r\n\r\nGiven the above, the precedent has been set for sharing this material with media, and there is no reason to deny my request.\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that these separate productions have intellectual property rights, and represent my competition, I cannot use any other media organization\u2019s material in my production.\r\nTherefore, I demand at least equal access to the same documents, files, recordings and reports that they had, up to and including interviews with Detective John Garcia, Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum, and Detective Ed Yee. \r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation. I think we would all rather avoid a First Amendment case on this matter, but I am open to pursuing every option legally available to me.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan",

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI am following up with my request for information that I submitted above -- Record request #25-4515 - a copy of  which I will  paste below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the two week extension you requested on 3 April 2025 has long since expired.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your cooperation in completing this request.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan\r\n\r\nCut and paste to follow:\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI am appealing your decision to reject my FOIA request for Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) files related to the murder of Dr. Haing S. Ngor, on February 25, 1996.\r\n\r\nThe previous rejection of my FOIA request cites the California Government Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, the LAPD has already made this material available to other media organizations, and therefore has no basis to deny them to my production of the investigatory podcast, \u201cWho Killed Haing Ngor?\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am repeating my request for the following material, marked by *** below.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Price of Duty,\u201d Season One; Episode 3, the LAPD has participated in production, or shared evidence, in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- This documentary revolves around an extended interview conducted with the full cooperation of Detective Sergeant John Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department.\r\n\r\n- This documentary was conducted with the full cooperation of with Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum.\r\n\r\n- This documentary features a prominent interview with Detective Ed Yee, and a conversation between him and Detective Sergeant Garcia\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned conversations with Detective Sergeant Garcia and Detective Ed Yee\u2019s and their revelation of and discussions about relevant content of the investigation could not have taken place without the consent of the LAPD.\r\n\r\nTo Wit:\r\n\r\nAUDIO\r\nDetective Sergeant Garcia and Deputy District Attorney Hum reference the contents of recordings of \u201cprior statements\u201d made by witnesses to police before the trial.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of the tape-recordings of \u201cprior statements,\u201d made by police, referenced by Hum and Garcia.\r\n\r\nThe LAPD shared with documentary-makers crime scene photos, including images from inside of the victim's vehicle; images of spent shell casings; pages from the Coroner's report; and diagrams from the crime scene.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of crime scene photos, including but not limited to those shared with documentary-makers, in preparation for their production. (This request includes those photographs shown to the producers of the documentary for selection of inclusion in their production, not limited to only those televised.)\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance in which investigative file contents were shared with the media.\r\n\r\nThese photos were also shared with media in \u201cThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor,\u201d a documentary produced in 2015 by Arthur Dong, of Deep Focus Productions, Inc.\r\n\r\nDuring this documentary, crime scene photographs were shared with the production team,\r\nincluding those depicting Ngor\u2019s body at rest; and exteriors and interiors of Ngor\u2019s apartment, and other photographs depicting evidence and police activities.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of all investigative file documents and photographs provided to producers for review for inclusion in their documentary.\r\n\r\nI have reached out both production companies with regards to what documents and photographs they were provided access to in the making of their films. However, I have yet to hear back.\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW GRANTED TO MEDIA\r\nIn 2024, Detective Ed Yee gave an on the record interview to Los Angeles-based production company, Western Sound, for their \u201cStrangeland \u2013 Killing Fields of LA\u201d podcast on the Ngor murder.\r\n\r\nAmong other investigative revelations Detective Ed Yee discussed, he also said, \"I had friends that lived right next door to Haing Ngor or lived across the street from Haing Ngor\" at the time of Ngor's murder.\r\n\r\nThis information was corroborated to me by a third party, known to me.\r\n\r\n*** Therefore, I request all notes and reports related to Detective Ed Yee\u2019s interviewing of those people and whether they identified any of the three defendants as possible suspects; and any written disclosures by Yee of his relationship with any of the potential witnesses.\r\n\r\n*** Based on Detective Yee\u2019s candid revelation of his participation in this investigation during a podcast interview, I would like access to all of Detective Yee\u2019s notes and reports.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, the precedent has been set for sharing this material with media, and there is no reason to deny my request.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that these separate productions have intellectual property rights, and represent my competition, I cannot use any other media organization\u2019s material in my production.\r\nTherefore, I demand at least equal access to the same documents, files, recordings and reports that they had, up to and including interviews with Detective John Garcia, Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum, and Detective Ed Yee.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation. I think we would all rather avoid a First Amendment case on this matter, but I am open to pursuing every option legally available to me.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan\r\n\r\n",

Ngor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government and does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure, records that are privileged or confidential, or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe are providing audio recordings&nbsp;responsive to your request, subject to the following exemptions under&nbsp;California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

Ngor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government and does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure, records that are privileged or confidential, or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe are providing audio recordings&nbsp;responsive to your request, subject to the following exemptions under&nbsp;California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

I apologize for not having been able to locate these records on your website myself initially. \r\n\r\nBut I'm just following up now because unfortunately I still cannot locate the CVR data on your webpage. Really sorry about this - I've spent a lot of time at the link you provided looking for CVR data of any kind but have had no luck. I am attaching a screenshot of what the page returns when I search for just the 2024 General election.  In the screenshot you can see that under \"Data Exports\" only the precinct level returns are available to download across all formats (pdf, csv, html). These data provide just the vote totals by office and precinct. I don't see anything about CVR records anywhere, including under the advanced search. I have also attached the CSV file that is output when I click \"Precinct Results\" just for your reference in case it is helpful.\r\n\r\nMy sincerest apologies for the hassle with this. I am trying my hardest to locate the records myself on your website but I have just been unable to find what you describe in this email. I would be extremely remiss to create additional work for you but I am at a loss. I hope you understand, and thank you very much again for your time and patience. \r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\nAleksandra Conevska ",

Your request was received in this office January 28, 2026, and assigned control number 2026-FSA-02533-F. Please use this control number for all future communications regarding this request.\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are unable to begin processing your request at this time because we cannot determine precisely which records you are seeking.  In your request form, you state that you are requesting\r\n\u200b\r\n\"the 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 applications to receive subsidies under the programs: Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), Milk Loss Program (MLP), Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) for the following producers: * Varel Dairy; Bartelso, Illinois. * Thole AG; Aviston, Illinois. * JB Timmermann Farms; Breese, Illinois.* Four Beck Dairy; Bartleso, Illinois. * C D & R Farms, Inc.; Breese, Illinois.* Dall Dairy; Aviston, Illinois * Glen Von Bokel Farms; Carlyle, Illinois * Aaron Hilmes; Carlyle, Illinois * Corey Hilmes; Breese, Illinois * Arentsen Farms; Albers, Illinois\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\nHowever, we need to confirm whether you have written consent from the producer(s)/entity(ies) listed above to receive unredacted copies of their DMC, MLP and DIPP applications?  If yes, please provide a copy of the consent by replying to this email.  If not, are you willing to receive redacted versions of these documents instead?\r\n\r\nWe cannot proceed further with your request until we receive additional written clarification from you.  Please note that if we do not hear from you within 20 business days from the date of this email, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and we will administratively close your request.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you requested a fee waiver. You were placed in the \u201cMedia Use\u201d requester category, as such all fees are waived.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you also requested expedited processing of your request. According to USDA regulations at Title 7, CFR 1.9(b), it is the policy of FSA to grant a request for expedited processing whenever the requester demonstrates that the request involves:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information\r\n\r\nYou state that you are requesting expedited processing of your request, because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity, however, your letter did not provide an adequate justification to support your argument.  Therefore, we are processing your request on a \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d basis in the complex track.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the determination to deny your request for expedited processing is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator.  The Appeals and Litigation Staff must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.

With respect to these pages, we are releasing 8 pages in full,  72 pages redacted in part, and zero (0) pages withheld in full, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) and (b)(6) of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nElectronic copies have been sent as attachments to this email.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DMC, Milk Loss Program (MLP), and Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) documents for Glen Von Bokel Farms and Arentsen Farms, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for MLP documents for Varel Dairy,  Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms, Inc, Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DIPP documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms,  Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for 2020 DMC documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nExemption 3 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3): protects information included in FSA's records specifically exempted from disclosure by another Federal Statute.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 3, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nIn this instance Section 1619(b) of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (7 USC \u00a7 8791), prohibits disclosing the information requested.\r\n\r\nThe records you have requested include information that FSA has obtained from agricultural producers or landowners that concerns their farming or agricultural operation, including production and marketing of agricultural commodities and livestock, farming practices, conservation practices or the land itself.  The type of information withheld includes producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address. This information is required to be provided to FSA for the agricultural producers and/or landowners shown on these records to participate in FSA's farm programs.\r\n\r\nExemption 6 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6): Exemption 6 protects personal information affecting an individual's privacy.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 6, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, exemption 6 protects personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The courts have held that the phrase \"similar files\" involves all information that applies to a particular person. When disclosure of information about particular individuals is requested, the courts have decided that it is necessary for us to determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly \"unwarranted\" invasion of the individuals' privacy. To make this determination, we are required to perform a \"balancing test.\" This means that we must weigh the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to disclosure. In this instance, we have determined that the disclosure of this information would shed little or no light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties and that, on balance; the public interest to be served by its disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals in question, in withholding it. The records withheld under this exemption are producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address.\r\n\r\nIf you believe our decision to withhold this information is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator. The Appeals and Litigation Division must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.  You may submit your appeal electronically to FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov<mailto:FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov>  or by mail.

The requester seeks the complete A-file and all USCIS records concerning an Emory University F-1, J-1, and M-1 nonimmigrant students (SEVIS-tracked) student whose SEVIS record was terminated without notice between 2015 and the present. The requester\u2019s identity and A-number are withheld to protect privacy and safety, but the requester is the subject of the records and expressly consents to disclosure to the filing organization for immediate forwarding to the requester.\r\nRequested records:\r\n1.\tThe complete Alien File (A-file), including all electronic records. \r\n2.\tAll Forms I-20, reinstatement applications (I-539), OPT/CPT approvals or denials, and related correspondence. \r\n3.\tAll internal USCIS communications with Emory University, its DSOs, SEVP, or ICE regarding the requester\u2019s SEVIS-tracked nonimmigrant status or SEVIS termination. \r\n4.\tAny administrative record of a reinstatement decision and any entries reflecting accrual of unlawful presence.\r\nTime period: January 01, 2015 \u2013 December 18, 2025.\r\nFee waiver is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) in light of due-process deprivations akin to Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), and Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). Expedited processing is requested under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(iv) due to ongoing litigation urgency and irreparable harm (Kuck Baxter v. DHS, N.D. Ga. 2025; Liu v. Noem, D.N.H. 2025).\r\nAll records received must be forwarded to the anonymous requester in full within five (5) business days of receipt, without additional redactions.\r\nThank you.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nMuckRock News on behalf of Anonymous Requester\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nneutralrequest47",
