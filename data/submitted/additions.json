Specifically, this grant and sub-award are described on USASpending.gov:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nMy initial FOIA request was rejected with the following text: \"There are no records responsive to your request. There were no technical or research reports for this project.\" See IDA Letter 2025-00131-F. I am sending a copy of this IDA letter to DHA.FOIAappeals@health.mil , as requested in the said letter.\r\n\r\nI want to draw your attention to the fact that $750,000 were paid to Wayne State University by the DOD. This included a sub-award WSU23001 in the amount of  $218,562  to Michigan State University. Sub-award description found on the same USAspending.gov page is as follows:\r\n\r\n'IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #1, WE WILL EXPOSE GYRENCEPHALIC FERRETS (N = 48), WHICH ARE UNLIKE LISSENCEPHALIC ANIMALS (MICE AND RATS), TO RF WAVES FOR TWO HOURS/DAY FOR SIXTY DAYS USING A SOURCE \r\n OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EXPOSURE PROFILE THAT IS LIKELY COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL RECEIVED. SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMALS (N = 24) WILL RECEIVE SHAM EXPOSURE. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN ANIMAL MODEL WITH THE BRAIN STRUCTURES RESEMBLING THE GYRENCEPHALIC NATURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN; MICE AND RATS DO NOT FULFIL THOSE CRITERIA.\r\n \r\n IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #2, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER RF WAVE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, COCHLEAR, OR VESTIBULAR CHANGES AMONG THE FERRETS AFTER TWO MONTHS COMPARED TO SHAM \r\n EXPOSED ANIMALS.\r\n \r\nPROJECT MILESTONES\r\n OUR MILESTONES WILL BE: (1) FULL ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL AT TWO MONTHS; (2) TESTING OF RF WAVE GENERATOR/RECEIVERS BY THE FOURTH MONTH; (3) TESTING COHORTS OF FERRETS [8 FERRETS/MONTH] FOR RF WAVE EXPOSURE WITH BEHAVIORAL, RADIOGRAPHIC, HISTOPATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR ANALYSES BETWEEN FOUR AND \r\n TWELVE MONTHS; (4) FINAL DATA ANALYSES AT ONE YEAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement of rejection issued in the IDA Letter 2025-00131-F doesn't  conform with the information available on the USAspending.gov webpage describing Project Grant FAIN W81XWH2211105 and sub-award WSU23001:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",
