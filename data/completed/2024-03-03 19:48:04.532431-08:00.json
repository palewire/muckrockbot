        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting that the classified documents other and all documents pertaining to the following subjects be declassified and / or released forthwith. I know the Agency is in possession of a large number of these documents and it is long over due for them to be presented to the public and the families of those affected.\r\n\r\nSS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (from here on referred to as SS General) Hans Kammler Dr. Engineer (alternate mis-spellings of his name have been found in official files prior, so please expand searches). The SS General was in charge of numerous German special projects, THE J\u00c4GERSTAB, the rocket forces and underground production and research facilities. ALL captured by US forces in 1945 April and May 1945, These locations listed below were investigated fully, all content was documented, photographed, and much content, equipment, machinery, plane, rocket parts and research removed by US forces. By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created. Including reports made on this location and adjacent related locations.. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request information about which US companies that the collected information and German research was handed over to. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request ALL information about SS General Hans Kammler generated during and AFTER WW2. And all information regarding the SS Generals interactions with OSS agents, during the war and after, and Furthermore all documentation regarding the SS Generals life post- war. His interrogations and collaborations with US entities after 1945. And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise it was eventually collected and or copied to CIA files, especially those hand overs from the OSS. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII. Huge underground tunnel system, underground, with several multi-stories underground bunkers and communication centrals. (AMT 800 and AMT 10) Also 25 unfinished tunnels were found in the Jonas Valley. However on the adjacent German proving ground  experimental test sites were found for Nuclear weapons. remains were found, witnesses interviewed and entrances to large underground facilities were found and investigated by US army personnel, later documented by various Intelligence agencies and military Intelligence, OSS and ALSOS teams. Including the FULL report of the ALSOS teams findings at the nearby and related Nuclear Reactor site at the school building in Stadt-Ilm under command of Scientist Kurt Dibner. and actively covered before handing over of the area to the Russian army. The area was liberated April 4 1945 by the US army (4th Armored and 89th ID). I request all documentation of what was found, documented, filmed, inventoried and removed from these locations. This location was also under the command of SS General Hans Kammler. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request all the above information which in short is all information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer  Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel factories and Jonastal SIII. Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTino Von Struckmann",

        "communication": "Dear Tino Von Struckmann,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your February 14, 2024 Freedom of Information Act\r\nrequest (#24-24698) about \u201call information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (SS\r\nGeneral) Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel\r\nfactories and Jonastal SIII.\u201d We received your request in the Textual\r\nReference Branch at the National Archives in College Park, MD (Archives II)\r\non February 15, 2024.\r\n\r\nWe make reasonable efforts to assist researchers with their work. As a\r\nmatter of policy, the National Archives is staffed to assist researchers\r\nwith their work, including but not limited to pointing researchers to\r\nhelpful finding aids to begin their research. However, given the\r\nlimitations on staff resources, we do not generally conduct substantive\r\nresearch in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct, except in circumstances where documents are easily locatable.\r\n\r\nYour request primarily consists of a stated topic rather than describing\r\nspecific documents, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us\r\nto be in a position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.\r\nA preliminary search of the finding aids that are available to us reveals\r\nthat your request could contain information in a number of series in\r\nvarious record groups.\r\n\r\nFor example, European Name Index to the Series \"Case Files, 1944-1949\"\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1683246> (entry A1 142) in the Records of\r\nthe Office of the Judge Advocate General (Army) (Record Group 153) and\r\nlocated one card for \"Kammler, Dr.\" (see image 1039)\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/166832179?objectPage=1039> that might be\r\nof interest to you. This index has been digitized and may be viewed online\r\nusing the National Archives Catalog link provided. The card for Dr. Kammler\r\nincludes the case file number 110-10. That file is located in box 101 of\r\nthe series Set-Up Files, 1944\u20131949 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1692305>\r\n(entry A1 145) in Record Group 153. Although the Set-Up Files have not been\r\ndigitized, they are already open and available for researchers to access\r\nwithout submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Please\r\nemail the Textual Reference staff at Archives II at\r\narchives2reference@nara.gov for more information about these records.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives Collection of World War II War Crimes Records (Record\r\nGroup 238) also includes multiple references to Hans Kammler\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=%22Hans%20Kammler%22&recordGroupNumber=238>\r\nand Kammler, Hans\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=%22Kammler%2C%20Hans%22&recordGroupNumber=238>\r\nin several series related to Case No. 4, United States v. Oswald Pohl, et\r\nal. These records have been digitized and may be viewed online using the\r\nCatalog links provided.\r\n\r\nNext, we searched the non-digitized Personal Name Index, as well as the\r\nIndex to the Director\u2019s Files (Microfilm Publication 1642), to the Records\r\nof the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (Record Group 226), but we were\r\nunable to find any reference to Hans Kammler in these indexes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, National Archives Record Group 319: Records of the Army Staff\r\ncontains Investigatory Records Repository (IRR) files accessioned by the\r\nNational Archives from the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command\r\n(USAINSCOM). The IRR files are military intelligence and Counter\r\nIntelligence Corps (CIC) files maintained by USAINSCOM and its\r\npredecessors.

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS        *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Treasury:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Treasury component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA administrative record in matters with successful administrative appeal\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire administrative record in FOIA matters which involved a successful administrative appeal, as defined below. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nI believe that these records are of substantial public interest, because they would reveal:\r\n* how the FOIA administrative appeals process works in practice, e.g. what kinds of arguments are successful on administrative appeal, what actions are taken by the appealed-to entity, what kinds of relief are granted, and why;\r\n* whether such aspects of FOIA administrative appeals are consistent, both within and between agencies, which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances;\r\n* effects of OGIS mediation on administrative appeals;\r\n* the extent to which agencies comply with the administrative appeals process (or don't), e.g. in responding to requests made by the appealed-to entity, or obeying their decisions; \r\n* policy/pattern/practice violations which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances, to detect repeated violations (as determined by the appealed-to entity) that an agency has not systemically corrected; and\r\n* courts' responses, and agencies' Vaughn filings, in the context of successful administrative appeals.\r\n\r\nI believe that the records should be very easy to locate, because virtually all of them should be in the possession or control of the agency's FOIA office itself. (Of course, it is the entire agency, not merely its FOIA office, to whom the legal standards of FOIA apply, including \"possession or control\", \"reasonably described\", etc. This is simply a comment about the extremely convenient access to the records requested.)\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nFOIA provides for administrative appeals. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) (notice), (a)(6)(A)(ii) (procedure), & (a)(6)(E)(ii)(II) (expedition).\r\n\r\nThe procedural terms used in this request should be interpreted broadly, according to the following definitions.\r\n\r\nThe \"appealed-to entity\" is typically the agency's chief FOIA officer. However, some agencies (like DHS) outsource their appeals to another entity (e.g. for DHS, to the Coast Guard Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge).\r\n\r\nAn \"adverse determination\", as used in this request, means whatever a requester appealed about. This includes both a formal response under (a)(6)(A)(i), and any other issue raised on the appeal. This specifically includes \"administrative closure\", failure to respond, etc., regardless of whether the agency deems it a \"determination\" or \"adverse\".\r\n\r\nAn \"administrative appeal\", as used in this request, includes any attempt to use the administrative appeals process. It does not include OGIS mediation (which isn't an appeal), nor llitigation (which isn't administrative). However, it does include requests made to the appealed-to entity or to the agency, styled or otherwise clearly intended to be an appeal, regardless of whether the agency agrees with that characterization, if the appealed-to entity took any action in response.\r\n\r\nAn appeal is \"successful\", as used in this request, if the appealed-to entity:\r\n* agrees with the requester;\r\n* disagrees with the initial adverse determination;\r\n* remands to the agency or reverses the agency;\r\n* orders, requests, or otherwise indicates that the agency should do or not do anything;\r\n* overrides any part of the original adverse determination; or\r\n* anything other than complete agreement with the initial adverse determination, and complete dismissal of the appeal, as the appealed-to entity's only response to the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe \"administrative record\", as used in this request, includes everything that is administrative record for the request, appeal, or OGIS mediation, as well as key parts of any ensuing litigation, such as:\r\n* the request;\r\n* follow-up communication to or from the requester, or OGIS, including determinations, close-out letters, releases, etc.;\r\n* the appeal;\r\n* all communication to or from the appealed-to entity; \r\n* all ensuing communications, determinations, re-appeals, etc.; \r\n* any complaint, Vaughn filing, opinion, or order in ensuing litigation;\r\n* all administrative record resulting from any ensuing litigation, e.g. after court remand;\r\n* all attachments to all of the above; and\r\n* all metadata for all of the above (see provisions below).\r\n\r\n## Priority\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize records in the following order:\r\n1. communication to or from the appealed-to entity (i.e. breadth first, limited to the successful appeal), further prioritized as:\r\n  a. administrative appeal orders and opinions of remand or reversal;\r\n  b. other such appeal communication records;\r\n2. all record in a given matter (i.e. completeness of record in a given matter); and\r\n3. most recent matters (by date of successful administrative appeal decision).\r\n\r\n## Dual track processing\r\n\r\nI request that you process priority 1(a) records \u2014 remands & reversals \u2014 under the \"simple request\" track.\r\n\r\nI agree that the remaining records are \"complex request\" track.\r\n\r\nPlease note e.g. the provisions below regarding rolling updates. \r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Sai: \r\nThank you for your email concerning the status of your Freedom of Information Act request.  Currently, your request is in the review queue. \r\nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.  Your request is considered complex.  During the last fiscal year, complex requests were processed on average within 347 business days.  Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request by June 20, 2024.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \r\nThank you, \r\nReNay Royster FOIA@treasury.gov",

Name Employee ID Badge/star number Date of hire at MPD All previous employing agencies\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon review, as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) does not capture the \"All previous employing agencies\" of such employees in a readily searchable electronic database, such a request would require an inordinate amount of manual research to locate and collect the requested information among thousands of files and records, and would either require the creation of new records to compile and assemble such information, or the review and redaction of a large volume of otherwise nonresponsive material.  As this request asks for an unreasonable volume of research , and associated processing that is not required under the FOIA, on behalf of the requester, we are not able to further process this request.  That is, we are not able to perform a reasonable and adequate search for specific records.  Therefore, this is not a \"perfected\" request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the District of Columbia (DC) FOIA, DC Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-531-539, provides that while a person has the right to request access to existing records, it does not require agencies to do research, analyze data, answer written questions, or create records to respond to a FOIA request.  I note, however, that a listing of District of Columbia (DC) employees (including MPD officers), salary, agency and job titles, and other data can be accessed at Public Employee Salary Information | DCHR<https://dchr.dc.gov/node/821352>).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, even if a reasonable and adequate search could be performed with either the creation of new records to compile and assemble such information, or the review and redaction of a large volume of otherwise nonresponsive material, the records you seek are subject to withholding pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2), which covers information of a personal nature, the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Such privacy information includes names/personal identifiers and other personal privacy information, including that which may lead to the identity of individuals, in combination with \"previous employing agencies\".  Other FOIA exemptions may also apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this letter to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to:  The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>.  Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Eckert\r\n\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia\r\n\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"",

We note that the requests are limited only to records in our custody and control.\r\nThe Alameda County Sheriff's Office is in the process of searching for responsive, non-exempt data regarding your request.  After review, we will have a cost estimate for you (if any), and upon receipt of payment from you (if any), we will produce these materials.  If deemed necessary, we may have to produce on a rolling basis. We estimate the search to be complete within three weeks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your requests, ACSO asserts that certain documents requested may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code Sections 7927.500, 7927.200, 7927.700, 7923.600-7923.625, 7927.705, 7922.000, 7922.540(a) and possibly additional subsections, and Government Code Sections. ACSO also asserts, certain documents; potentially responsive to your requests, may be shielded by the attorney work product doctrine and the attorney client privilege. Further, some documents may contain confidential information that is protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additional privileges may apply based on a review of the records.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9EBE9.D37B49C0]\r\nCynthia Wilson | Sheriff's Technician #235\r\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\nInternal Affairs | 3 Park Pl., 3rd Floor, Dublin, CA 94568",

However, the names of attachments are redacted in the emails (with the exception of agency logos), making it impossible to link which attachments that were produced go with which emails.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for \"Emails with representatives of the New York University Policing Project from 2021 to present\u2026emails sent to or received from an email address with the domain \"@nyu.edu\" or \"@policingproject.org\" that were sent between 01/01/2021 and 03/05/2023.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA search was conducted and responsive records have been released to you.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the records contain minimal redactions to protect information that is exempt from disclosure under express provisions of the California Public Records Act, including California Government Code Sections 7922.000, 7923.600, 7927.200, and 7928.300.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I'm very glad to finally be getting real data - it's been three years of chasing various agencies to get this.\r\n\r\nI do have several questions.\r\n\r\nThe filename includes the word \"redacted\", but it's an excel spreadsheet, so I obviously can't see any markup. Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",

The only redactions in this dataset were columns that contained personally identifying information like names, phone numbers, email addresses, and so on. No row-level information has been redacted.

The spreadsheet is a record of various inspections performed by various agencies during the time period specified.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/jpinsof/131963/table.pdf\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpleasanton-police-department-12146%252Fsb34-alpr-data-sharing-pleasanton-police-department-158023%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AABK3lQCyUhd6Tui1sBbajFcXP0%3A1rWqFp%3Amg6s0svpMMwZRg9Ugao0KTakYiFDsJZClsc8mLW9ADA \r\n \r\nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed.

Pursuant to the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., you requested the following:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.\tAll communications between the Office of the Pardon Attorney\r\nand the White House from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n2.\tAgency records related to pardon or commutation requests\r\ntransmitted to the White House from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n3.\tAll records received from the White House regarding\r\ncommutations and pardons from July 28, 2017 to August 31, 2017\r\n4.\tA list of all commutations or pardons granted by President\r\nDonald J. Trump\r\n5.\tAll records related to Joe Arpaio received, sent, or maintained\r\nby the Office of the Pardon Attorney\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to requests numbers 1, 2, and 3 above, please be advised\r\nonce again that deliberative (pre-decisional) communications pertaining\r\nto agency and presidential decision-making are confidential and not\r\navailable under existing case law interpreting the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act and Privacy Act.  In addition, pursuant to 28 CFR \u00a7 1.5\r\n<https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2001-title28-vol1/pdf/CFR-2001-title2\r\n8-vol1-sec1-5.pdf> , petitions, reports, memoranda, and communications\r\nsubmitted or furnished in connection with the consideration of a\r\npetition for executive clemency generally shall be available only to\r\nthe officials concerned with the consideration of the petition.\r\nMoreover, as a general matter, Presidents in recent times have rarely\r\nannounced their reasons for granting or denying clemency, although the\r\nPresident may choose to do so in a given case.  Consistent with\r\nlong-standing policy, if the President does not issue a public\r\nstatement concerning his action in a clemency matter, no explanation is\r\nprovided by the Department of Justice.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of your request and the fact that OPA does\r\nnot have the ability to perform broad and conclusive email searches\r\nin-house, I will have to request a search be conducted across emails to\r\nor from all OPA employees by the Department of Justice's Office of the\r\nChief Information Officer (OCIO), so your request falls within \"unusual\r\ncircumstances.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Because of these\r\nunusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to\r\nyour request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\r\nUntil OCIO completes a search to determine whether there are any\r\nrecords within the scope of your request, I will be unable to review\r\nresponsive records and provide an estimated response time.  The time\r\nneeded to process your request will depend on the number of data\r\nrequests in queue prior to yours, the complexity of their records\r\nsearch, and the volume of any records located as being potentially\r\nresponsive.  For your information, this Office assigns incoming\r\nrequests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited.  Each\r\nrequest is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to\r\nother requests within the same track.  Simple requests usually receive\r\na response within one month, whereas complex requests take longer. At\r\nthis time, your request has been assigned to the complex track because\r\nit is not one that can be responded to without the assistance of\r\nanother DOJ office.  You may feel free to inquire back about the status\r\nof your request at any point, but I can assure you that I will review\r\nand provide a response to your request as soon as the results of the\r\nsearch have been provided to me and I am able to review any potentially\r\nrelevant records for responsiveness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to request number 4 above, please be advised once again\r\nthat there is no need to FOIA this information because it is publicly\r\navailable and proactively disclosed on our website at\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients> .  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith regard to request number 5 above, the only releasable document\r\nwithin our files at this time is the clemency warrant signed by the\r\npresident, but it has also been proactively released and can be\r\ndownloaded from our website at\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump>\r\n  You may have read news reports indicating that Mr. Arpaio did not\r\nsubmit a pardon petition through the Department of Justice so we did\r\nnot have a clemency casefile created for him, which is where we would\r\nhouse all records related to his petition, had one been submitted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou may email this office at PardonAttorneyFOIA@usdoj.gov\r\n<mailto:PardonAttorneyFOIA@usdoj.gov>  for any further assistance with\r\nyour FOIA request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of\r\nGovernment Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services\r\nthey offer.

Legislature.\u00a0 The Court determined that each individual legislators\u2019 office is considered an \"agency\" for the purposes of the public records act (PRA) and therefore each individual legislators' office is subject to the disclosure requirements of the PRA, but not the Senate or House as an institutional body. \r\n\r\nPlease note that a specific and much more narrow definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d applies to the Chief Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate.\u00a0 For the Office of the Chief Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate, which includes staff of both legislative bodies, RCW 42.56.010 and RCW 40.14.100 define the scope of that term. \r\n\r\nAlso, the crime free rental housing program that you seek records about was codified in RCW 35.106.020, not RCW 25.106.020 as you cite in your request.\u00a0 I will assume this is just a typographical error on your part unless you are seeking records for some other program. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you are more likely to find responsive public records with local governments since the crime free rental housing program applies to local governments.\u00a0 Once we receive your clarification we will make a diligent search for senate records.\u00a0 However, you may consider submitting your request to local governments that have adopted these programs, or to the State Auditor who may have records related to an audit or other report. \r\n\r\nThe adoption of a program is voluntary, so not all local governments may have a program.\u00a0 The Association of Washington Cities (AWC) and the Washington State Association of Counties (WSAC) represent local governments.\u00a0 AWC & WSAC may know which cities and counties have adopted such programs, and you may ask AWC & WSAC for a list of local governments that have adopted a program, and then you can make individual public records requests to those local governments. \r\n\r\nYour clarification is needed to specify which senators or representatives that you would like records from for this request.\u00a0 We will close this request unless you provide clarification by January 22, 2024.\u00a0 After the request is closed, you may submit a new request to receive additional records. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSenate Public Records",

I'm a little confused by it, though, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nYour response says: \"To view your Public Record Request, you can use the following link Public Record Request (https://reno.streamlinegov.us/PublicRecordRequest/Detail?caseId=48720) \" \r\nI created an account on that site and logged in, but the only message I see is \"no records found.\" \r\n\r\nFurther, I believe the law requires a more complete explanation for rejecting my request, under NRS\u2002239.0107 1(d)(2): \"a citation to the specific statute or other legal authority that makes the public book or record, or a part thereof, confidential.\"\r\n\r\nThe 2/20/2024 response you sent states that the records will not be released because of \"Donrey of Nevada v. Bradshaw ((106 Nev. 630, 798 P.2d 144 (1990))\" and \"Personal Information (NRS239B.030 / 603A.040)\"\r\n\r\nDonrey is a case that set out a judicial balancing test for weighing the public policy considerations of releasing versus withholding certain records. It isn't, in and of itself, a justification for withholding specific records. Please explain the balance you struck in this specific instance: Why does public policy justify withholding rather than releasing the records I requested?\r\n\r\nNRS239B.030 / 603A.040 are lengthy and multifaceted statutes pertaining to personal information held by government agencies. Can you please explain precisely what in those statutes justifies withholding the records I requested? \r\n\r\nIn your 2/21/2024 response, you stated \"Due to the active court case, no call for service was given.\" Can you please specify what Nevada law requires withholding calls for service when court cases are active? \r\n\r\nFinally, just to be clear: There are zero records related to the incident at the Starbucks located at West 7th St and Keystone Ave, at approximately 7:45 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 17, 2024 that can be made public? I'm hoping you can clarify based on NRS\u2002239.0107 1(c)(2)' s requirement that entities \"make a reasonable effort to assist the requester to focus the request in such a manner as to maximize the likelihood the requester will be able to inspect, copy or receive a copy of the public book or record as expeditiously as possible.\" \r\n\r\nThanks for your help, I appreciate that public records work isn't straightforward or easy.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
