Please note, previously, this information has been released to the public. Back in May 2019 Texas Credit Union Department provided a record containing the information (with dates 2017-2019) I am requesting that was then posted on a public website (www.muckrock.com). The information I am requesting is public and has been made public in the past (2019).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Ricker",
