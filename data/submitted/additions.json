Delayed access would hinder the public's ability to hold the government accountable and ensure adherence to civil rights protections.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nThis request serves the public interest by promoting transparency and accountability within the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. It seeks no commercial benefit and qualifies for a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nTimelines and Compliance\r\nFOIA requires a determination within 20 business days. Failure to meet this timeline will prompt escalation to the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) and potential legal remedies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n\r\nIf no records exist, please confirm this in writing as required by law.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment and Accountability\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request immediately and provide the following:\r\n\r\nAn estimated completion date as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7).\r\nThe name, title, and contact information of the FOIA officer(s) processing this request.\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely response in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
