It also says that when the acting ACIJ was an IJ, he sent a fake email purporting to be from the EOIR Director to a third party. This is deeply concerning. Immigrants ordered removed by this person have a right to know if he is a biased adjudicator and if anything he did might reflect bias that would have affected their removal proceedings. Accordingly, we intend to obtain through the FOIA and publish the full report.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock",

See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). I also redacted certain information which could reveal the identities of undercover police officers or informants.\u00a0This information is exempt from the Inspection of Public Records Act.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). If made public, the redacted information would seriously interfere with the effectiveness of criminal investigations and prosecutions, and endanger undercover police officers or informants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive Records:\r\n\r\n* Reports (Invoiced)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe responsive records are available for purchase, please see the invoice that was released to you for the price and mailing address; once we receive payment, we will mail the records to you; you may also come into our office to pay for and pick up the records with exact cash or check/money order.

Leonard, Sr. (1982-1959).\r\nYour request was received in this office, Archives II Textual Reference, on\r\nthe date of March 24, 2025 and assigned FOIA case number 25-38773.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library\r\n<https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/> may contain records relating to\r\nPresident Eisenhower\u2019s Inauguration Ball, so we have cc\u2019d them above and\r\nthey will provide a separate response.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the National Archives is the repository for the\r\npermanently valuable non-current records of the Federal Government.\r\nAlthough only 1-3% of the records created by the Federal Government are\r\ntransferred to the National Archives, our holdings consist of hundreds of\r\nmillions of records, the vast majority of which are not name-searchable.\r\nYou will need to begin your research by determining the agency with which\r\nyour subject interacted and exactly what types of records you wish to see.\r\n\r\nWe also suggest that you request a copy of his Official Military Personnel\r\nFile (OMPF)\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/about-service-records-0>.\r\nOMPFs and individual medical reports for individuals who served with the\r\nU.S. Army who were separated from the service after October 1912 and before\r\n1960 are in the custody of NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)\r\nin St. Louis. In many cases where personnel records were destroyed in the 1973\r\nfire <https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/fire-1973>, proof\r\nof service can be provided from other records such as morning reports,\r\npayrolls, and military orders, and a certificate of military service will\r\nbe issued. Please complete a GSA Standard Form 180\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/files/research/order/standard-form-180.pdf> and\r\nmail it to NARA's National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel\r\nRecords), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. Veterans and next of\r\nkin of deceased veterans also may use eVetRecs to request records. See eVetRecs\r\nHelp\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/evetrecs-help.html>\r\nfor instructions. If there is any information requested by the form that\r\nyou do not know, you may omit it or provide estimates (such as for dates),\r\nbut the more information you provide, the easier it will be to locate the\r\ncorrect file if it survived the fire. For more information see Official\r\nMilitary Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/military-personnel/ompf-archival-requests>\r\n.\r\n\r\nArchival OMPFs may also be requested by visiting the Archival Research Room\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/research-room> at the National Archives\r\nat St. Louis <https://www.archives.gov/st-louis>.

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Please let me know when I can expect to receive a response. This communication was originally to greg.hebert@oxnardpd.org. Please see the following request. \r\n---\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords of your agency related to the deployment and use of controlled equipment obtained through the 1033 Program of the Department of Defense, as set forth below.\r\n\r\nAccording to records posted by the Defense Logistics Agency (https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/), your agency acquired controlled equipment through the 1033 program, including firearms, as reflected in the attached spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nI. Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_request_attachments/Alpha/116902/California1033ControlledEquipent.xlsx\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Foxnard-police-department-347%252Fuse-and-policies-for-controlled-firearms-acquired-through-1033-program-oxnard-police-department-116902%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAcqyVPgf5zmxy4fjIgt1uZrBI%3A1trVjQ%3AHNCHPJ9SdtbFw9stwbUr0sIH1mOjOIWali8ozfThGW4\" \r\n \r\n You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed.

Bodycam footage reportedly captures officers encouraging Nino\u2019s father to physically discipline him, dismissing allegations of abuse, and making statements such as \"Your dad should beat you\" and \"You have no rights.\" A confrontation ensued when Officer Willer attempted to take Nino\u2019s phone, resulting in officers using force against him. Nino suffered a broken wrist, facial lacerations requiring stitches, and was subsequently hospitalized. He was charged with aggravated assault, though charges were later dropped.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nSpoke with Sergio Nino\u2019s father before engaging with the teenager.\r\nInteracted with Sergio Nino, including advising his father on discipline.\r\nUsed force on Nino, leading to his injuries and subsequent arrest.\r\nTransported Nino from the scene to medical facilities or booking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",

Your request was received by this office on February 19, 2025, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-1282-F. You requested the following: \n1. The current org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office, reflecting vacancies as of February 18, 2025.2. The org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office on January 18, 2025, reflecting any vacancies on that date. \nYour request for expedited processing has been denied because you have not demonstrated that you meet the threshold requirement of being a person primarily engaged in disseminating information. Please note that due to current resource limitations we are experiencing prolonged delays in the processing of requests as we are working through a backlog. \nIf you are not satisfied with OPM\u2019s determination, you may administratively appeal in writing by email to OGCAtty@opm.gov.\u00a0An appeal should include a copy of the initial request, a copy of this email denying your request for expedited processing, and a statement explaining why you believe the decision is wrong. Appeals must be electronically transmitted within 90 calendar days of the date of this email. \nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS by e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or by mail at: \nOffice of Government Information Services \nNational Archives and Records Administration \n8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS \nCollege Park, Maryland 20740-6001 \nWe appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We don\u2019t have a \u201cBrady List\u201d per se.  There is one deputy that works for the Skamania county Sheriff\u2019s Office for whom we have potential impeachment information and for whom we provide a memo summarizing the circumstances.  We provide this memo when required to defense counsel on cases involving this deputy.  Because there is only one local deputy for whom we maintain PID information, there is no list.  Just the single memo, which we are happy to provide.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-wide potential impeachment issues with WSP employees.  We do not maintain this information in any organized way because it does not apply to any officers that regularly appear in our courts/cases.  I just want to confirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extent that these records are related to WSP employees, are likely better sought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (in addition to any lists).\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding.  Joseph will follow up with you acknowledging the request and will get you a copy of the PID memo I referenced above.\r\n\r\nadam",

My name is Joseph Anderson\u00a0and I am a Deputy Public Records Officer\u00a0for Skamania County. I assist inreviewing and responding to public records requests (PRRs) for alldepartments. \r\n\r\nOn April 07, 2025, I received your public records request for \"All current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\" \r\nAs previously mentioned by Prosecutor Adam Kick in response to your request: \" We don\u2019t have a 'Brady List' per se.\u00a0 There is one deputy that works for the Skamania County Sheriff\u2019s Office for whom we have potential impeachment information and for whom we provide a memo summarizing the circumstances. We provide this memo when required to defense counsel on cases involving this deputy. Because there is only one local deputy for whom we maintain PID information, there is no list. Just the single memo, which we are happy to provide [please see attached]. The Washington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-wide potential impeachment issues with WSP employees. We do not maintain this information in any organized way because it does not apply to any officers that regularly appear in our courts/cases. I just want to confirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extent that these records are related to WSP employees, are likely better sought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (in addition to any lists).\" After reviewing our files, we have located records that are responsive to your request. Please log in to the Skamania County Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the records responsive to your request: County Public Records Request - C003218-040825 \r\nSkamaniaCounty has searched for, attempted to identify, locate, and provide anynon-exempt public records that may be responsive to this request. Since this completely fulfills your request, we are now closing this public records request. The one (1) yearstatute of limitations to seek judicial review under the Public RecordsAct (Chapter 42.56 RCW) begins now because Skamania County does notintend to further address this request. Please note that if you do not review and download your records within thirty (30) days, they may be removed from the system, in which case you will have to start the public records process all over again to receive your requested records. \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in awaiting this information. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns by replying to this email or at my phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson \r\nDeputy Public Records Officer \r\nOffice of the Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney \r\n240 NW Vancouver Avenue | PO Box 790 \r\nStevenson, WA 98648 \r\n509-427-3791",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally acknowledge your Freedom of Information Law (\u201cFOIL\u201d) request, received by the College on March 6, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe College will respond to this request, by providing the records requested, to the extent that they exist and may be disclosed, on or before April 10, 2025.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the numerous questions contained in your request, please note that Article 6 of the New York State Public Officers Law, known as the Freedom of Information Law (\u201cFOIL\u201d), permits members of the public to request and inspect \u201creasonably described\u201d \u201crecords\u201d of public agencies.  It is not, however, a mechanism for posing and receiving answers to written questions.  As stated in FOIL Advisory Opinion 16632a<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f16632a.htm>, issued by the New York State Committee on Open Government:  \u201cVery simply, there is nothing in the Freedom of Information Law or the Open Meetings Law that requires that government officers or employees respond to questions, supply information in response to questions or offer explanations for their governmental activities.\u201d  Furthermore, as explained in FOIL Advisory Opinion 18795<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f18795.html>, \u201can agency need not create a record in response to a request for information.\u201d  Therefore, to the extent that the College does not maintain records which may be responsive to several of the questions listed below (i.e., average tenure, current turnover rate, how frequently are job description updated), the FOIL statute does not require to a public agency to create records in order to respond to a FOIL request.\r\n\r\nNote that once responsive records \u2013 i.e., the College\u2019s payroll and collective bargaining agreements -  are gathered in response to this FOIL request, they may contain answers to some the questions posed below (i.e., how are salaries adjusted, date compensation plan(s) were implemented, do you compensate faculty differently based on the area of discipline, etc.).  However, the answers will be able to be retrieved from a review of the relevant collective bargaining agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlla Brodsky, Esq.\r\nDeputy General Counsel\r\nSuffolk County Community College\r\nAmmerman Campus\r\nEmail: brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu<mailto:brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu>\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL\r\nATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT\r\nINTER-OFFICE/INTRA-AGENCY COMMUNICATION\r\nNOT SUBJECT TO FOIL DISCLOSURE/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION\n",

I am\r\nrequesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther\r\nReporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that\r\nappears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different\r\nthan the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for\r\nTitle IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation\r\nfor the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s)\r\non which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of\r\notherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform\r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer\r\nthe request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or\r\nCD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is August 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request small processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is April, 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?
