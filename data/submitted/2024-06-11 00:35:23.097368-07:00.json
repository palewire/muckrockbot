        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Vermont Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWhile teaching a forensics class to high school 20 students in June, Burlington police officers staged a surprise demonstration in which a masked gunman burst into the room and pretended to open fire. \r\n\r\nTeachers said BPD officers told them that they'd previously used the lesson with college students and adults, and that they wanted the event to be \u201cas realistic as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn its statement, the Burlington Police Department said school staff approved the demonstration\u2019s content ahead of time and agreed to let parents and students know. The simulation would involve \u201cfake firearms in a mock shooting,\u201d the department said it wrote to school staff on May 23. \r\n\r\nI am looking for:\r\n\r\n- planning documents, memos, emails or other communications about the planning of the described demonstration\r\n- emails between the department and the school staff about the scheduled demonstration. Please include the May 23rd email to school staff \r\n- after action reports or communications within the department after the incident.\r\n- surveillance footage of the incident or recordings of the incident\r\n\r\nAs required under the law, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the statute.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
