Saylor from 2021 to the present. Please include any records, files, communications, reports, supplemental reports, 911 calls, dispatcher logs, dash cam, audio, body cam, photographs,  and investigative records. Per the denial of my previous requests for not being specific enough I am specifying that I am looking for records that the Police Department has indexed to the name of Kristi Saylor and which would be filed in 2021 to the present. I know these records exist as I contacted the police department due to harassment. I am also looking for any records relating to complaints or reports made about 272 West Ludlow St. Summit Hill PA 18229 from 2017 to the present.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKristi Keeler",
