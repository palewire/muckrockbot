Under FERPA, it is considered \u201cdirectory information,\u201d along with other basic information like the student\u2019s email, major, dates of attendance and enrollment status. It is common for entities that want to advertise to students to request this publicly available contact information \u2014 everything from apartment complexes, to credit cards, to political candidates and so there is no exemption that will prevent release of this information unless individual cadets specifically sign a statement to have their information \u201cwithheld.\u201d Under federal law, directory information is not considered private unless students opt to withhold it from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741- 5769.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).

Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 5.8.Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control.

Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.

My internet has been constantly tampered with, and things have been found missing from my home.  I have not committed any crime.\u00a0 I have no reason to believe that I am, nor have I ever been, a threat to national security.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf it is not any government organization perpetrating these harmful tactics, then I would like any insight on what organization has been allowed to harass me for so many years.\u00a0 I have been told that the government outsources to services such as \u201cInfra Guard\u201d and others.  Clearly, I have not been arrested for anything in my adult life, and if I am being harassed daily by a government agency, I'd like to know why I am being denied my right to due process.\u00a0 If it is not a government\u00a0agency behind it, I'd like any information on what organization has been allowed to get away with violating my privacy and my rights as an American citizen.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor ten years, I have had coordinated attempts to harass and intimidate me, up to and including people tampering with my phone, turning its flashlights on randomly through no fault of my own, or making calls without my doing.  I've had my phone ring while it was turned off, in front of witnesses.  I've also had people come up to me in the street and tell me to \u201cbe careful what I say in my letters\u201d, not to mention more subtle, but all-too frequent attempts to insinuate that they know intimate details of my personal life.  It may be executed by a wide swath of coordinated individuals, but it is a daily occurrence.  In fact, it is almost every time I go outside. I am hereby giving you as much information as I can in the hopes that you can help me rectify this situation.  \r\n\r\nIt is my hope that I can uncover information about what organization is harassing me, and if it is in fact due to \u201cinvestigative\u201d status, I'd like to do what I can to clarify that I have never had any intention to commit any crime whatsoever.   I am frankly not competent enough for terrorism, but I am willing to do what it takes to follow the chain of command and put this harassment to a stop.  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration.\u00a0 I declare under penalty or perjury that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal DHS's determination that I am not entitled to TSDB documents regarding any investigation that persists against me.  I understand that there are claims that my private information being kept from me may be justified under the auspices of \u201cNational Security\u201d, but I would like to know why my right to due process is being violated by a wide array of individuals with seemingly ceaseless access to my personal information and an unending budget that could only be funded by a large organization.   I have not committed any crime, and I've been stalked and harassed for (2014-2024) ten years, not simply \u201cinvestigated\u201d.  Your email implies that I would have access to specific information that I am not privy to.  I am asking for data on any and all elements of investigation status, or history on me, including actions taken against me.  \r\n\r\nPlease find my initial request below, followed by the denial letter that I was told to include in my appeal.   I am stating under penalty or perjury that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and understanding.  \r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: PRIVACY ACT REQUEST UNDER 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\nRobert Donald Zylo\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: xx-xxx-9444. Date of birth is 03-30-1981. Place of birth is Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n\r\nArvo Zylo\r\n2519 1st Ave\r\nSeattle, Washington 98121\r\n\r\narvozylo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRe: 2024-HQFO-03143\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking copies of all information pertaining to you contained in the following systems of records maintained by the CBP and DHS: Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to your request for information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia-027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied.\r\n\r\nThe Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact the analyst below and refer to 2024-HQFO-03143. You may send an e-mail to foia@hq.dhs.gov, call 202-343-1743 or toll free 1-866-431-0486, or you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison in the same manner. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974. You may contact OGIS as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia \r\n\r\nSENT VIA E-MAIL TO: arvozylo@gmail.com Arvo Zylo 2519 1st Ave Apt 708 Seattle, Washington 98121 Re: CISA Case Number 2024-NPFO-00889 Dear Requester: This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning you or your activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom we have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place your name on the TSDB. As it relates to item \u201ca\u201d of your request, based on the limited information you have provided, we cannot conduct an adequate search. The Department of Homeland Security was created January 24, 2003; therefore, no DHS records exist prior to that date. Records created prior to the establishment of DHS by any of the organizational components of DHS would be maintained by those components. Furthermore, DHS does not maintain a central index of records about individuals. For this reason, the DHS FOIA regulations, at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. In addition to the information that you provided, this description should include, the type of record you are seeking, the DHS component you believe created and/or controls the records, the precipitating event that you believe warranted the creation of records and the time period that you believe the records or files were created and compiled. If you can provide sufficient additional information as described in this paragraph, we will undertake a search for responsive records. An individual\u2019s request for information pertaining to him or herself is processed under both the FOIA and the PA to afford maximum access to records. Because you have asked for copies of records about yourself, we must verify your identity to ensure that your personal information is not released to anyone other than you or someone you properly designate. The DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(a), require verification of your identity, including your full name, current address and date and place of birth. In addition, your request must be made in writing, must contain your signature, and should either be notarized or contain a statement made under penalty of perjury as permitted by 28 U.S.C. 1746. Because you have not provided this documentation, your request is not a proper FOIA/PA request, and we are unable to initiate searching for responsive records. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. Please provide additional information describing the records you are seeking. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this PA request, and the case will be administratively closed. Additionally, we determined that some of the information you are seeking is not under the purview of DHS. Requests for FBI and USDOJ records, should be made to the FBI and DOJ respectively. In an effort to assist you on this matter, we are providing you with the following contact information: Federal Bureau of Investigation Attn: Initial Processing Operations Unit Record/Information Dissemination Section 200 Constitution Drive Winchester, VA 22602 Submit Online: FBI Records: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) For questions about the process please email foipaquestions@fbi.gov Please be aware DOJ is organized into a number of bureaus, divisions, offices, and boards, which are referred to as \"components.\" Within DOJ, each component processes its own records in response to FOIA requests. A list of DOJ FOIA Contacts is available at: Office of Information Policy | Find a FOIA Contact at DOJ | United States Department of Justice. If you believe that DOJ maintains the records you are seeking, but you are uncertain about which component has the records, you may send your request to the Department\u2019s Mail Referral Unit at: FOIA/PA Mail Referral Unit Department of Justice Room 115 LOC Building Washington, DC 20530-0001 Phone: (202) 616-3837 E-mail: MRUFOIA.Requests@usdoj.gov Office of Information Policy | Make a FOIA Request to DOJ (justice.gov) Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. As it relates to the remainder of your request regarding information on the TSDB, please be aware that information incorporated from the TSDB and/or WLS is information that is categorized as Sensitive Security Information (\u201cSSI\u201d) under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r), and the implementing regulation found at 49 C.F.R. part 1520. Records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor can they be released to anyone who does not have an official need to know under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.9(a)(2) and 1520.15(a). Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Federal Bureau of Investigation has exempted its system of records containing the TSDB from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including \u00a7552a(d), which provides for amendment and access rights. DHS obtains TSDB information from the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the FBI\u2019s exemption carries over when the TSDB information is transferred to the Department. In addition, the Department\u2019s Privacy Act systems of records that are authorized to receive TSDB information via the WLS, see Privacy Impact Assessment for the Watch List Service available at https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-all-pia027c-watchlist-service-update , are also exempt, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), and/or (k)(2), from various provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a(d). Accordingly, to the extent records responsive to your Privacy Act request exist, your client has no right to access or amend the records contained in these systems and your Privacy Act request, as amended, is denied. The Department is required to also process your Privacy Act request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(t)(2)and 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.1. Under FOIA, the Department can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records that could reveal your client\u2019s status in the TSDB, because either a confirmation or denial that such records exist constitutes SSI, which is protected from release by FOIA exemption 3 (\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u2026\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The applicable exempting statute is 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(r). Additionally, if any such responsive records existed, they would also be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(7)(E). Therefore, our FOIA analysis requires no change in our determination under the Privacy Act. You have the right to appeal this determination to neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 245 Murray Lane, SW, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R.
