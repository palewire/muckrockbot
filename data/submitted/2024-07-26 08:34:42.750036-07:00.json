        "communication": "Dear National Park Service:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to NPS mascot Freddie the Flathead Catfish, the mascot of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Freddie the Flathead Catfish mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to NPS's decision to create a mascot for the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in the first place. \r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Freddie-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Freddie costumes. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Freddie.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all photographs of Freddie. You may omit any photographs already posted to the agency\u2019s Flickr page https://www.flickr.com/photos/134392837@N04/albums/.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all correspondence related to Freddie (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some mascot-related correspondence around 2019.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using Freddie as part of NPS's public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Section 4.2(a) of this order requires that companies inform the federal government if they are \"developing or demonstrating an intent to develop\" AI models or computing clusters that exceed certain computing power thresholds.\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of information, reports, and records sent to the Commerce Department by companies pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, I am requesting records sent by Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, and any other companies that have disclosed AI models or computing clusters pursuant to Section 4.2 between October 2023 and the present.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAaron Holmes",
