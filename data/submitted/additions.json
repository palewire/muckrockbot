All reports about COVID-19 prepared by the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company that were provided to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) between the dates of 5/1/2020 and 7/1/2020 related to long-term care facilities and/or nursing homes and/or COVID-19 regional hubs in Michigan.\r\n\r\n2. All emails sent to, from, and/or between any of the following individuals and/or email addresses between the dates of 5/1/2020 and 7/1/2020:\r\n-  Any email address ending in \" @mckinsey.com \";\r\n- Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer in April 2020 as part of the State of Michigan's response to COVID-19. The hubs were intended to provide care for COVID-19 positive senior citizens, as reported in the Detroit News: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/06/23/hubs-picked-care-covid-19-seniors-have-low-quality-ratings/3244493001/\r\n\r\nMcKinsey & Co. is a global management consulting firm whose work regarding various government responses to COVID-19, including vaccination efforts, have come under scrutiny recently in the U.S. (https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mckinsey-is-making-100-million-and-counting-advising-on-the-governments-bumbling-coronavirus-response) and in France (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html). The firm's government contracts were also the subject of a recent public records lawsuit in Tennessee (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tennessee-sued-not-releasing-covid-221610057.html). McKinsey & Co. also recently came under scrutiny in the national press over potential conflicts of interest related to the firm's relationships with pharmaceutical companies and regulators (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/business/mckinsey-purdue-fda-records.html).\r\n\r\nWhen providing the records related to this request, please make sure to specifically certify that no other responsive documents related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If the fee for this request exceeds that amount, please notify me for permission prior to initiating work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nPlease send all documents related to this request to this email address.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",
