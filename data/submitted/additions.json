        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Ohio Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request access to and copies of all records related to the arrest of Cathy S. Luks on September 27, 2023, in Parma, Ohio. Ms. Luks, 66, a former mayor of North Royalton, was involved in a high-speed chase following a minor speeding violation. The pursuit concluded when she collided with a tow truck after jumping a curb. During the arrest, body-worn camera footage reportedly captured Ms. Luks asserting, \"I\u2019m the former mayor!\" before officers used pepper spray due to her non-compliance. She was subsequently charged with Operating a Vehicle under the Influence (OVI), failure to comply, and possession of an open container.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from all officers involved in the traffic stop, pursuit, and arrest of Cathy S. Luks\r\nAll available dashboard camera (dashcam) footage from all patrol vehicles involved in the incident\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and witness statements\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports\r\nAny photographs taken by the Parma Police Department during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, her vehicle, the crash scene, and any evidence recovered\r\nThe full arrest affidavits and any related charging documents filed in this case\r\nAny internal reviews or reports related to the use of force during the arrest, including documentation of the deployment of pepper spray\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Parma Police Department regarding this incident\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from the dissemination of these materials, the request primarily serves to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
