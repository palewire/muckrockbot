Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Sunny Saguaro mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to NPS's decision to create a mascot for Saguaro National Park in the first place. Community engagement coordinator Cam Ju\u00e1rez may have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Sunny Saguaro-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Sunny Saguaro costumes. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Sunny Saguaro.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all photographs of Sunny Saguaro.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all correspondence related to Sunny Saguaro (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some mascot-related correspondence around 2019.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using Sunny Saguaro as part of NPS's public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Hope buying yourself three weeks was worth it.  Also, you know I don't drive so it would be nice if you'd do the answers in the NORMAL WAY and not put them on a thumb drive so you can have me trot on down there and you can see who brought me.  That's what this is, isn't it? Inconvenience and a few giggles, well, send me the answers to the questionnaires, and the other stuff you neglected to ad. Keep thinking everyone is stupid. Go ahead it's served you well so far, right?\r\n\r\nDustin, dear, you can go ahead and write me another little bitch out note about how this has nothing to do with Felton but we both know that at this point, it does. Plus, YOU are still an officer of the court. Tick tock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe request all responsive ANSWERS  from the employees and any further correspondence from any supervisor to any employee or from supervisor to supervisor to the questionnaire's that we received in open records. We request all documentation that accompanied these questions and their answers and further request and disciplinary measures that generated from any questionnaires that have been handed out by ANY supervisor in the past 13 months. \r\n\r\nAll letters of explanation from Aaron Burns, James Wolfe, Brad Stovall, Tim Davenport, Martin Arellano, Rose Peterson, Dustin Losak, Pete Peterson, Hunter Herring, Parnell McNamara, Jeremy Bost, Cody Blossman, Mike Gates, Colt Braziel, All Jail Sgt's. Any questionnaires that any of the employees have answered in the past 13 months, any letters \r\n\r\nWe also request any and all disciplinary actions that have been issued since Cody Blossman has been Chief Deputy or in the past 13 months.  We would like to include all disciplinary records that are being kept in supervisors desk and not placed in the personnel files as these are government documents and we are requesting them. The fact that these disciplinary records may be being kept in a desk or file does not exempt them from being subject to open records as all disciplinary measures are open to the public to view.  \r\n\r\nWe request the names of all employees who have resigned or been terminated from the McLennan County Sheriffs Office since Cody Blossman has been chief deputy or in the past 13 months. \r\n\r\nWe further request any and all emails and correspondence between Cody Blossman and Anna Picasso for the past 13 months.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front (NWLF). The NWLF was a radical left-wing terrorist group that formed on or around November 23, 1973, with the bombing of a Pacific Gas and Electric utility substation in Cupertino, California. Over the next six years, the NWLF was credited with bombings throughout the United States; one instance, in 1976, involved members of the organization placing an explosive device on a windowsill at the home of then-San Francisco Supervisor (and later United States Senator) Dianne Feinstein. NWLF membership overlapped with another organization the FBI monitored in this same period: the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). SLA members Bill and Emily Harris claimed membership in the NWLF at the time of their arrests, in 1975.\r\n\r\nThe FBI, at various points during the 1970s, identified the NWLF as a subject of interest in ongoing investigations. Page six of a memorandum located in the FBI's HEARNAP records (dated October 11, 1974; HEARNAP Part 21, page 41) contains what appears to be a Bureau file number for the NWLF at its Los Angeles Field Office: \"LOS ANGELES IS CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE CASE CAPTIONED 'UNSUB; BOMBING OF SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL, 9750 AIRPORT BOULEVARD, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 5, 1974' EID - NEW WORLD LIBERATION FRONT, 00: LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES FILE 174-2103.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a September 7, 1978 bulletin created by the FBI Terrorism Research Center outlined a detailed history and methodology of the NWLF, stating, in part: \"[I]ncidents, over 70,  have ... occurred in Seattle, Washington; Rainier, Oregon; and Aurora, Colorado. Victims of NWLF attacks have included Federal, state and local governmental functions, diplomatic establishments, corporate facilities, and public utilities. Communiques claiming responsibility for the incidents state the actions were staged to protest against governmental policies and the intervention of the U.S. corporations into the internal affairs of foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nBoth items indicate that the FBI created HQ and field office files for the NWLF in the course of investigations into terrorist attacks carried out by the organization. Therefore, I am requesting copies of all FBI records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front, aka the NWLF.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of investigations into left-wing terrorism. The FBI has already made public records related to the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in its HEARNAP collection. Contained in these records are numerous references to then NWLF, yet the FBI has not released any records on this group. Contemporaneous and postmortem accounts of the NWLF identify that Ms. Hearst interacted with NWLF members before her capture, thus the release of all NWLF records would contribute significantly to public understanding of the FBI's handling of the HEARNAP case.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the NWLF carried out attacks on public officials and public services for almost a decade. Understanding how the FBI responded to these attacks is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Your FOIA request seeks any and all documents regarding, evidencing, or detailing violations, warnings, cautions, fines, penalties, judgments, agency determinations, and/or enforcement inspections from 1972 to present against the following entities\r\n\r\n- BNSF Railway\r\n- Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway\r\n- Burlington Northern Railroad\r\n- St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Railway\r\n\r\nThe FOIA and agency regulations require requesters to reasonably describe the records they seek.. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A); 49 CFR \u00a7 7.24(d). Your request, as described, seeks 51 years and 7 months\u2019 worth of records. This is a significant amount of information and is too broad and complex in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the FOIA and agency regulations, the agency is not required to process requests that require an unreasonably burdensome search. FRA asks that you reformulate and/or narrow the scope of your request (e.g. provide a shorter time frame; prioritize the subject matter that you would like to receive first), to limit the burden on the agency. You may visit FRA's website to search for and locate documents that may assist you in better defining the scope of your request at https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/ (e.g. railroad accident data or reports, including railroad supplied accident reports for specific accidents).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, FRA records retention periods vary depending upon the specific type of records, also are available for public on the NARA site: Records Control Schedules | National Archives<https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/index.html?dir=/departments/department-of-transportation/rg-0399>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide a response within 14 calendar days of the date of this email. If we do not receive a response from you, we will administratively close your request without further notice.\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nThe FOIA Office",
