To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA list or summary of projects from January 1, 2020, to present that include units designated under the Homeless Housing Set-Aside Policy,\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\nProject name\r\n\r\nDeveloper\r\n\r\nNumber of set-aside units\r\n\r\nFunding status (approved, pending, denied)\r\n\r\nAny internal tracking documents, summary sheets, or compiled records maintained by the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing that reflect use or implementation of the Homeless Housing Set-Aside Policy.\r\nThis request does not seek full funding applications\u2014only summary-level MOH documents.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, the Homeless Housing Set-Aside Policy referenced in this request is posted at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.boston.gov/departments/housing/policies\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the term \"Homeless Housing Set-Aside\" has been used consistently in public communications by officials , including:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.taxcreditadvisor.com/articles/talking-heads-sheila-dillon-neighborhood-development-city-of-boston/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dotnews.com/2021/affordable-housing-numbers-city-2020-earn-good-reviews\r\n\r\nhttps://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2025/03/Boston%20Resident%20Preference.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/sheila-a-dillon.bsky.social/post/3llyttp5lss23\r\n\r\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/sheila-a-dillon.bsky.social/post/3lk76z5jfsc2n\r\n\r\nhttps://content.boston.gov/news/mayor-wu-announces-40-million-grant-funding-available-affordable-housing#:~:text=Four%20million%20dollars%20of%20funding,%2C%22%20said%20Mayor%20Michelle%20Wu\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bostonhousing.org/en/News/Mayor-Wu-to-Invest-$40-Million-to-Create-and-Prese.aspx\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bostonplans.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2023/04/18/mayor-wu-announces-community-preservation-act-fund\r\n\r\nGiven the City's repeated public use of this terminology, the request is clearly defined and not vague. If no such summaries or tracking records exist, I request written confirmation per 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c).\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

These medical records are crucial to the adoption of these K9s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request encompasses, but is not limited to, all records of complaints received, inspection reports, investigative files, and any other documents generated or compiled by the Bureau in connection with said investigations. Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is crucial to myself, as I am the current adopter of a Contract Working Dog (CWD) that Anne Gibbs had her in possession for a period of time. I state 'Her Possession' because to refer to it as 'Care' would do a disservice to CWD Cezar. He was one of the 28 K9s that were seized from her property, and rescued from PSPCA, where he remained until I adopted him. In addition, this case is  demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved. There are several posts on Anne Gibbs public social media page, which I believe, are possible indicators of continued neglect.\r\n\r\nI currently serve as a K9 Handler in the Private Sector, along with a branch of the Department of Defense. I am a Nationally Certified K9 Handler, with extreme knowledge and certification of these working K9s.  I am also still serving as a member of the United States Army, as a Military Police Officer. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on USB/CD-ROM. I can provide the CD-ROM/USB if requested. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nJulia Valenti\r\nCPT, MP\r\nCommanding\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
