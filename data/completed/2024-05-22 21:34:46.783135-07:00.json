The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 17th and 18th were sent on 03/29/2024 and 4/19/2024 respectively, neither of which have been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause these installments of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

A copy of the April 25, 2024 memo or letter to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, as reported at https://www.kxan.com/news/leaked-memo-reveals-inside-details-of-uts-protest-response/ \r\n\r\n2.

The purpose of this letter is to ask that you clarify or narrow your request by providing us with more information about the particular records you seek. The following paragraph highlights the aspect of your request that we find to be unclear or overly broad. \r\n \r\nThe document being referred to as a \"memo\" in that KXAN article seems to be the internally-circulated talking points document that KXAN posted online here: https://twitter.com/RyanChandlerTV/status/1783887440152756489. This is not a memo and was not sent to the Palestine Solidarity Committee. \r\n\r\nIn light of these facts, we ask that you please clarify what document you are looking for with this request. Are you looking for the talking points \"memo\" that the KXAN article is referencing, a document that was sent to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, communicating their interim suspension, or something else? \r\n \r\nPlease let us know how you wish to proceed. Upon receipt of your response, we will resume work on your request.\u00a0 You may deliver your response by replying to this email or by any one of the following means: \r\n \r\nBy U.S. Mail: \r\nAttn:\u00a0 Open Records Coordinator \r\nOffice of the Vice President for Legal Affairs \r\nThe University of Texas at Austin \r\nP.O.

Specifically, I am requesting records regarding the FBI's handling of FOIA request guidelines and search programs, including keystring searches and searches used for interagency communication requests for digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents on related subjects.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to reference the following relevant case law:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989): This case established the fundamental purpose of FOIA as providing the public with access to information that the government may not otherwise make available.\r\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Department of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2014): This case held that agencies must disclose any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is not exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\r\nNat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case established that agencies must provide a specific and legitimate justification for withholding any requested information.\r\nMilner v. Dep't of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011): This case held that agencies cannot withhold information under FOIA unless the requested information falls within a specific exemption.\r\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004): This case held that agencies must conduct an adequate search for requested information under FOIA.\r\nI kindly request any records, including policies, procedures, manuals, and training materials, that outline the FBI's guidelines and procedures for conducting searches in response to FOIA requests. I also request any records that detail the types of search programs or techniques utilized by the FBI in its FOIA search process, including keystring searches and interagency communication requests.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I kindly request any records, including digital memos, documents, emails, or paper documents, related to the FBI's handling of FOIA requests and search programs. These records should include any guidance provided to FBI personnel regarding the handling of FOIA requests and the methods used to search for responsive records.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the FBI has an obligation to provide the requested records unless they are exempt under FOIA. If the FBI withholds any requested records or deletes any responsive information, it must provide a detailed explanation for doing so.\r\n\r\nI kindly request expedited processing of this request, as the information sought is of great public interest and urgency. If expedited processing is not possible, please process this request in the normal course.\r\n\r\nFinally, if any portion of my request is denied, please provide the specific legal basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf my request is denied in whole or in part, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the disclosure of the requested information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

While I understand the denial of expedited processing, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that the FBI's search procedures and protocols used in response to my FOIPA request were inadequate and incomplete.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that the FBI has not conducted an adequate search for responsive documents. The FBI's search must be reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. However, I have reason to believe that the search conducted was not thorough and did not encompass all locations where responsive documents may exist.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the search conducted by the FBI is demonstrated in the fact that no responsive documents were provided in response to my request. This leads me to believe that the search procedures and protocols used were insufficient in locating any responsive documents. As such, I request that the FBI conduct a new search for responsive documents using more comprehensive search procedures and protocols.\r\n\r\nI also request that the FBI provide me with a detailed explanation of the search procedures and protocols used in response to my request. Additionally, I request that the FBI provide me with information regarding the locations searched for responsive documents and the search terms used to identify responsive documents.\r\n\r\nTo support my request for a more comprehensive search, I would like to refer to several court cases that have upheld the principle that government agencies must conduct a search that is reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. In Tax Analysts v. United States Department of Justice, 845 F.2d 1060, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held that \"the search must be reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents,\" and that \"the failure of an agency to uncover all relevant documents can be evidence that the search was not reasonably calculated.\" Similarly, in Weisberg v. United States Department of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court held that the agency's search must be \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that the FBI conduct a more comprehensive search for responsive documents, and provide me with the requested information regarding the search procedures and protocols used. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

We anticipate it will take approximately fifty (50) hours for review for responsiveness related to this part of the request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of your request (#2 above) resulted in over 19,000 emails, which would result in hundreds of hours of review. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third part of your request (#3 above) is being processed and we will provide you with an estimate or charges once we review the extensiveness of the records. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile UNC Charlotte has every intention of complying with our statutory public records obligations, we have determined that your request requires extensive clerical and supervisory staff. The basis for this determination is the scope of this request, including reviewing over 22,000 emails. According to University Policy 605.8 (available at\u00a0http://legal.uncc.edu/policies/up-605.8), this expenditure of time constitutes \u201cextensive clerical and supervisory assistance\u201d as defined by North Carolina Gen. Stat. \u00a7132-6.2.\u00a0Since your request is considered extraordinary, it will incur a special charge at a presumptive rate of $18 per hour applied after the fourth hour of work on the request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of the request, would you like to revise or narrow the search, especially the first and second parts of your request? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to proceed with your request by Monday, May 6, 2024. We will resume per your direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss, I\u2019m available at (704) 687-8592. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTina Dadio\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at UNC Charlotte.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

We anticipate this will take around four (4) hours to compile and review for responsiveness.

Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail how a private employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the federal government, or acting under the direction of the federal government under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing per the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and given the direct nexus to SAMHSA under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3.

If it's easier to do on a call with you, or with someone else in your office, we'd appreciate that as well.\r\n\r\n- Tab number 4 doesn't seem to correspond to the summary sheet's #4. The breakdown sheet's tab 4 has grant status as DENIED as opposed to GRANTED and the total is 2962 compared to 198,712.\r\n- For number 2 and 4, why are the orders granted numbers so incredibly high compared to number of petitions filed in #1? Are the orders numbers cumulative in nature meaning each year's data includes all previous years too? Can you please explain how these relate to number of petitions filed?\r\n- Tab 15 is missing from the breakdown sheet\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the breakdown sheet tabs is much higher than what is listed on the summary page- Tabs 5, 11, 14 & 16\r\n- For a few of the tabs, the totals in the summary sheet is higher by a little (ranging from a few hundred to a handful) but there's no explanation for that.- Tabs 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, & 13\r\n\r\nThank you again for continuing to help with this.

Some expire, some are temporary, some may even be reoccurring or overturned. The unit responsible for gathering the data you requested did it to the best of their ability. The status of a PFA, reasons for PFA's, and relation to firearm permissions is not always the same. Unfortunately, we are not a repository for all law enforcement agencies within Pennsylvania, so we cannot explain all variances in data. The PSP does enter information provided to us, but we do not maintain all records for all petitions.\r\n\r\nThe sheets correlate to the requested information with the exception of what was provided in the letter; \"15. The total number of firearms relinquished to attorneys at law,\" stated in the table,  and \"17. The total number of firearms that were not returned after the expiration of the order because the respondent was prohibited from firearm possession,\" as there is no data in our possession to provide for that.

At least some of the records I am requesting were previously posted on the Department's website (https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm). Although this page has since been removed, I believe that the Department still holds these records. Indeed, I confirmed with the New York State Archives that they have not received any documents relating to the Fast Food Wage Board.\r\n\r\nI ask that you expedite at least the release of the recordings of the 2015 Fast Food Wage Board meetings. Again, these recordings were previously posted on the Department's website, which suggests that they are of considerable interest to the public and do not require any review or redactions by your staff. Your own FOIL guidelines state that the timeline for responding to a request depends on \"the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors.\" (Quoted from the Process section of https://dol.ny.gov/freedom-information-law-foil-requests). These request-specific factors bely the claim in your extension message that you have an \"obligation to treat each request equally.\" Since the previously public Fast Food Wage Board documents do not need redactions or reformatting, it seems reasonable to expect that you can release them with a minimum of staff time.

Please note that I am not requesting any personally identifying information, but rather aggregate data for the aforementioned groups.\r\n\r\n2) All validation studies or technical reports detailing the unique predictive model created by EAB for the university and how it performs across different demographic groups.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

Any recording (including audio or video captured by body camera, vehicular camera, or handheld device) at Emory University on April 25, 2024. \r\n\r\n2. Any report concerning any arrest of or interaction with any demonstrator at or near Emory University on April 25, 2024.\r\n\r\n3. Any communications to or from the Emory University administration, staff, or security officials on or after April 1, 2024.\r\n\r\n4. Any communications to or from any elected official (including Gov.

For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

DPS will seek reimbursement for reasonable fees pursuant to our charging chart and consistent with Georgia law.  For fee information, please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71. You may review our charging chart for additional records https://dps.georgia.gov/charging-fees-open-records-requests.<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fdps.georgia.gov%2fcharging-fees-open-records-requests.%26nbsp%3b&c=E,1,vag6JEC44vf8iSa7qvUTYYBvm4OxY-huxfbRwiBcnOFERTT0Kr7CEBJ5msLdvu60qRF1gvqhruH0OHY0GWlgs0qRGESMIqB5mZDWCa3M2GZPLZ0hLg,,&typo=1&ancr_add=1>  If the cost is likely to exceed $25.00, we will get confirmation of your intent to pay before we proceed.  Please see O.C.G.A. \u00a750-18-71(d).\r\n\r\nPlease note that when an arrest is made, DPS cannot release criminal evidence such as dashcam video unless we are provided with a disposition sheet showing that charges are no longer pending, or authorization from the designated prosecutor for release, or a Judge's Court Order.  Please refer to O.C.G.A. 50-18-72(a)(4).  We have attached a sample form for your convenience.\r\nTo determine whether there is any responsive DPS email correspondence regarding \"any communications to or from the Emory University administration, staff, or security officials on or after April 1, 2024\" and \"any communications to or from any elected official (including Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, any member of the Georgia legislature, or any Member of Congress) or any member of the staff (such as aides, secretaries, or assistants) of an elected official concerning Emory University or the April 25, 2024 demonstration at Emory University,\" a query can be conducted with very specific parameters, per O.C.G.A.  \u00a750-18-71(g), to wit:\r\n\r\nRequests to inspect or copy electronic messages, whether in the form of e-mail, text message, or other format, should contain information about the messages that is reasonably calculated to allow the recipient of the request to locate the messages sought, including, if known, the name, title, or office of the specific person or persons whose electronic messages are sought and, to the extent possible, the specific data bases to be searched for such messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that DPS uses Barracuda, a platform designed and intended for \"security\" and not a \"search\" platform.  To that end, Barracuda captures individual words.  It does not capture phrases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe email search(es) will be conducted by an IT specialist with the credentials and ability to perform such a search on our protected system.  The specialist will enter your defined queries or attempt to determine such queries from the information you have provided (with the latter taking more time), monitor the processes for any interruption(s) that require a restart, download the captured returns, and then convert them to a readable format.  The hourly rate for the fulltime, credentialled specialist is $73.99 per hour, with the first 15 minutes free.  We have found that well-defined parameters from a requestor generally result in less time (approximately 30 minutes).  However, in circumstances of poorly defined parameters, we have discovered that there may be many hits and lots of attachments which are often irrelevant to the specified request, and likewise require more time to review for redactions of personal information and protected materials.  The remaining production tasks of review and redacting captured emails has a reimbursement rate of a designated employee who is credentialled to review emails ($25 per hour), with the general ability to review 100 pages per hour, depending upon the type of materials requiring the review.  After the query, we will provide any available, releasable records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that DPS has over 1,200 officers and even more civilian staff.  The way your search is currently worded, every employee email that contains the word \"staff\" for example, will be pulled.  To avoid unnecessary expense and emails that may not be relevant, please consider specifying your request and/or narrowing your parameters.  Lastly, if you confirm your intent to pay for the estimate, you're required to pay for the query time even if there are no responsive emails or if you choose not to pay for individual emails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you want to request a query estimate and specify your parameters so we may contact our IT specialist.  The remainder of your request for incident reports is in progress.  We anticipate providing a copy of any available, releasable records within two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\nNkenge Green\r\nAttorney Manager, Open Records Unit\r\nLegal Division, Suite 440\r\nGeorgia Department of Public Safety\r\n959 United Avenue SE\r\nAtlanta, Georgia 30316\r\nPhone: 404-624-7591\r\nFax: 404-624-7529\r\nngreen@gsp.net<mailto:ngreen@gsp.net>\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA9CBD.594EF630]\r\nhttps://eports.gamccd.net/orportal",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed.

If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City has identified documents which are responsive to your request.\u00a0A partial production of those records can be found attached to this letter.\r\n\r\nThe City is in the process of compiling and reviewing additional documents and anticipates being able to produce additional responsive documents by May 17, 2024.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions concerning your request, please feel free to contact me at kperez@berkeleyca.gov.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Berkeley.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, records have been redacted in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). Further, redactions have been applied pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. Please save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds if you just send me the .csv file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPlease save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. Please save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds if you just send me the .csv file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPlease save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
