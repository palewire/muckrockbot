If you have requested body camera footage, these requests can be lengthy and will cost a minimum average of $80 but could cost several hundred dollars due to many factors: \r\n  * How long was the law enforcement encounter? \r\n  * How many deputies were on scene? \r\n  * How much redaction will be required for public release?\r\n2. If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed. Thank you for using the Records Request Center.",

Village personnel applied for the Organized Retail Crime Grant through an online portal administered by the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We are not sure how other law enforcement agencies completed an application.  They may have prepared a paper application or have print-outs from the Attorney General\u2019s online portal.  But the Village of La Grange does not.  We cannot provide you records we do not have.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you desire to see the application materials completed in the online portal, you may want to submit a request to the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We assume that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has copies of all information submitted.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DB9500.D12604F0]\r\n\r\nDaisy Cabrera\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nVillage of La Grange\r\n53 S.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Documents mentioning or relating to Donald Henry Rumsfeld (July 9, 1932 \u2013\r\n    June 29, 2021), an American politician, government official, and businessman\r\n    who served as Secretary of Defense from 1975 to 1977 under Gerald Ford, and\r\n    again from 2001 to 2006 under George W.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

Deputy Lane, 27, was found off-duty and asleep at the wheel of his personal vehicle at a gas station around 2 a.m. He was subsequently arrested for DUI and placed on administrative leave without pay pending an Internal Affairs investigation.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from deputies involved in the response and arrest of Deputy Jonathon Michael Lane.\r\nAll available dashboard camera (dashcam) footage from patrol vehicles present at the scene.\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and witness statements.\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports.\r\nAny photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, his vehicle, and the scene.\r\nThe full arrest affidavits and any related charging documents filed in this case.\r\nAny internal reviews, use-of-force reports, or investigations conducted by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

The Email on Feb 26, 2025 12:19 PM, says, \"I will get back to you as soon as possible on the other items we discussed,\" and at 2:19 it says \"I should have most of your original requests shortly.\" - I do not see any records showing what those original requests were or any follow-up with what those items were and when they were provided. Please provide the missing documents or explain.\r\n3. The March 5, 2025 11:313 email states, \"I am getting updates on your other queries,\" but the results or the nature of the queries themselves seem to be missing. Please provide or explain.\r\n4. There is nothing in the file about FOIA charges. Were they not charged for this? That would explain it.\r\n\r\nThank you, and I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the fles online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfrm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent 56 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. No new or additional redactions have been made to this particular installment of records, and the responsive records appear just as they did when provided to the original requester. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email.

Accordingly, if we do not hear from you by February 7, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, you must click the link and either download the files or click on the files to open them, and you must notify us that you have accessed the files or that you are unable to access the records made available to you no later than February 7, 2022. Again, if you fail to respond to this notification by that date, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before February 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image004.png@01D803D0.B1CB20F0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a second installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional 36 of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (the original requester was the parent of the student whose education record it was). An Exemption Log for this record is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference was to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, these records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below. As requested, this is a public link and is not password protected.\r\n\r\n[\u200bFolder icon] Public Records Request \u2013 MuckRock PRA Audit<https://epscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/09566_apps_everettsd_org/ErZyFIvyVTBNqV9mmDkx-sEBSOkFAxLiwaKniCabzzGOWw?e=9lNHuO>\r\n\r\nThe system will not notify us when you access your records. Please reply to this email to confirm receipt of the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nPlease note that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link such as the one above, within 30 days you must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  click the link above; and\r\n  2.  download or click on the files; and\r\n  3.  notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know that you are unable to access the records made available to you.\r\n\r\nWe have yet received a response from you verifying receipt of our last installment provided on January 7, 2022. We are providing an additional opportunity for you to respond to our notifications that an installment of records has been made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by March 14, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, as we have not heard from you since your original request was made and we have not received confirmation of your receipt of the January 7, 2022 installment, we have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation of receipt of both installments provided to date. Upon such confirmation, the anticipated date for the next installment of records will be provided. Otherwise, your request will be deemed abandoned without further action as noted above.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D81F49.72D49E00]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

This installment represents one of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district\u2019s response to that request. While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. The detailed redaction/exemption logs, as they were provided to the original requester, are included. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided with the installment.

These records represent 1 public records request received in 2021 and 5 public records requests received in 2020, and the district responses to those requests. Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s name and other identifying information have been redacted and replaced with initials to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. In addition, a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB). The original requester was the parent of the student whose education record was requested, and the requester later abandoned her request, so there are no records to provide for that request.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records sent to the Superintendent, Ian Saltzman, on Tuesday, March 19, 2024, which was subsequently sent to the public records office for handling the same day. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, we seek the following clarifications of your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The appears to be a follow up to your most recent request which had a date range of January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Your renewed request reverted back to the initial date range ending November 4, 2021. Please clarify and confirm the date range of your request. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with the date range provided in your request today, for records between January 1, 2010, through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  In your former request for records, received by the district on October 9, 2023, you noted that \"Installments of Records previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Please clarify if this statement remains true, or if you would like us to produce installments previously provided to you again. If clarification is not received, we will move forward with your request as worded, and will reproduce any records responsive to this request that may have previously been provided. Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed.

We appreciate your communication with us.\r\n\r\nOur records indicate that delivery of the USB containing the responsive records for your request was delivered and received by MuckRock at 12:17 pm on April 8, 2024. Attached is a copy of the delivery confirmation email received by USPS.\r\n\r\nIn our April 4, 2024, communication we stated that we would accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records, and that upon that confirmation your request would be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. Accordingly, as your request stated that providing records on USB by mail to MuckRock was an acceptable method for delivery, and because all responsive records have been provided and confirmation of delivery of the records was received, your request was considered fulfilled and was closed on April 8, 2024. As the district does not have anything further to provide for this closed request, no further action is planned and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review began on April 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to locate the records previously provided, or if you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page:  https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA97E3.3798C4A0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

In that request, you asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday I am writing to let you know that we have an eighth installment of records available for you. These records include 24 public records requests received by the district between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. Please note that we acknowledge your request to receive records in reverse chronological order, however, there is one public records request during this timeframe (December 13, 2022) that will be provided in the next installment of records, as it is a large request requiring extensive redaction of student and parent personal information and it is still being processed. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355107600834<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355107600834> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records. Anticipated delivery date is Saturday, March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe district has confirmed delivery of the previous installment provided, which the district accepts as your receipt of the installment provided, which was delivered in or at the mailbox at 3:44 pm on Monday, January 27, 2025. A copy of the delivery confirmation for that installment is attached for reference. If you did not receive the records provided, please let us know.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate providing the next installment of records on or before April 9, 2025.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB886E.29686850]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWendy L.

When officers arrived, they attempted to reason with her, explaining that her father was not obligated to drive her. Despite multiple requests to exit the vehicle, Alexandria refused and was eventually removed from the car and placed under arrest. During the encounter, she made allegations against the officers and resisted arrest before being taken into custody.\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who responded to this incident.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",
