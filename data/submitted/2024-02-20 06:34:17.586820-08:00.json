        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter sent to Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, by Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, regarding anomalous health incidents, aka unconventionally-acquired brain injuries, aka Havana Syndrome. This letter is identified in a February 12, 2024 article in the New York Times, attached, as covering \"allegations of improper suppression\" of both information about anomalous health incidents and information about investigations into such claims conducted by American intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any supplemental materials that may have been attached to this letter, or in the absence of that, an inventory of all such materials with the names of the individual documents clearly identified.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents (AHI) are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2017, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba the year prior that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since then, AHI have continued to generate considerable media attention and stories focusing on the national security implications have appeared in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Based on sources in the Intelligence Community, journalists working for these publications have suggested that AHI may have been caused by directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves.\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, however, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an interim report stating that the agency found no evidence to support claims that a foreign adversary such as Russia or China was responsible for causing AHI. This was supported by an intelligence assessment published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on March 1, 2023, which states, in part, \"most [Intelligence Community] agencies have concluded that it is 'very unlikely' a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs.\"\r\n\r\nAs of January 2024, there have been over 200 reported AHI and many of the victims themselves believe they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any investigations into claims of AHI and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that, as part of the HAVANA Act of 2021, both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from AHI.\r\n\r\nAs of February 2024, Representative Brad Wenstrup, Republican of Ohio, and Representative April Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, introduced a bill titled the Initiating Imperative Reporting on Anomalous Health Incidents Act which would require the Secretary of Defense to brief the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on AHI.\r\n\r\nRep. Crawford's letter to DNI Haines represents another instance of continuing interest in AHI shown by legislators, journalists, and the public and should be made available for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Your request is excessively broad, and so broad that it is not permitted by the PRL. The Supervisor of Public Records requires that public records requests must reasonably describe the records sought. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a)(i). \r\nIn a recent Suffolk Superior Court case, the court found that under the PRL \u201c[t]he reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d , Suffolk. Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019). Chawla\u00a0v. Dep't of Revenue \r\nThe court further indicated \u201c[r]equests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently \u2018related\u2019 to the category of materials requested, will satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d not Id. (emphasis in original). \r\nIn accordance with G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a)(i) and the Chawla\u00a0decision described above, whereas you seek \u201call information and documents\u201d or \u201cany and all communications, documents, e-mails, text messages, voice recordings, and other information or tangible evidence\u201d \u201cpertaining\u201d to elections for example, it is unclear with \u201csufficient particularity\u201d which records you seek. Thus, your request \u201ccalls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently \u2018[regarding]\u2019 the category of materials requested.\u201d Chawla, at 2. \r\nTherefore, your request is not legal and not permitted under the PRL.",

I know the Agency is in possession of a large number of these documents and it is long over due for them to be presented to the public and the families of those affected.\r\n\r\nSS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (from here on referred to as SS General) Hans Kammler Dr. Engineer (alternate mis-spellings of his name have been found in official files prior, so please expand searches). The SS General was in charge of numerous German special projects, THE J\u00c4GERSTAB, the rocket forces and underground production and research facilities. ALL captured by US forces in 1945 April and May 1945, These locations listed below were investigated fully, all content was documented, photographed, and much content, equipment, machinery, plane, rocket parts and research removed by US forces. By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created. Including reports made on this location and adjacent related locations.. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request information about which US companies that the collected information and German research was handed over to. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request ALL information about SS General Hans Kammler generated during and AFTER WW2. And all information regarding the SS Generals interactions with OSS agents, during the war and after, and Furthermore all documentation regarding the SS Generals life post- war. His interrogations and collaborations with US entities after 1945. And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise this information may have been decentralized to various agencies, As it appears he lived in the US under a new name multiple agencies would have files on Hans Kammler none of these have yet been declassified and it is time to do this now. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII. Huge underground tunnel system, underground, with several multi-stories underground bunkers and communication centrals. (AMT 800 and AMT 10) Also 25 unfinished tunnels were found in the Jonas Valley. However on the adjacent German proving ground  experimental test sites were found for Nuclear weapons. remains were found, witnesses interviewed and entrances to large underground facilities were found and investigated by US army personnel, later documented by various Intelligence agencies and military Intelligence, OSS and ALSOS teams. Including the FULL report of the ALSOS teams findings at the nearby and related Nuclear Reactor site at the school building in Stadt-Ilm under command of Scientist Kurt Dibner. and actively covered before handing over of the area to the Russian army. The area was liberated April 4 1945 by the US army (4th Armored and 89th ID). I request all documentation of what was found, documented, filmed, inventoried and removed from these locations. This location was also under the command of SS General Hans Kammler. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request all the above information which in short is all information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer  Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel factories and Jonastal SIII. Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting that the classified documents other and all documents pertaining to the following subjects be declassified and / or released forthwith. I know the Agency is in possession of a large number of these documents and it is long over due for them to be presented to the public and the families of those affected.\r\n\r\nSS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (from here on referred to as SS General) Hans Kammler Dr. Engineer (alternate mis-spellings of his name have been found in official files prior, so please expand searches). The SS General was in charge of numerous German special projects, THE J\u00c4GERSTAB, the rocket forces and underground production and research facilities. ALL captured by US forces in 1945 April and May 1945, These locations listed below were investigated fully, all content was documented, photographed, and much content, equipment, machinery, plane, rocket parts and research removed by US forces. By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created. Including reports made on this location and adjacent related locations.. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request information about which US companies that the collected information and German research was handed over to. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request ALL information about SS General Hans Kammler generated during and AFTER WW2. And all information regarding the SS Generals interactions with OSS agents, during the war and after, and Furthermore all documentation regarding the SS Generals life post- war. His interrogations and collaborations with US entities after 1945. And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise this information may have been decentralized to various agencies, As it appears he lived in the US under a new name multiple agencies would have files on Hans Kammler none of these have yet been declassified and it is time to do this now. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII. Huge underground tunnel system, underground, with several multi-stories underground bunkers and communication centrals. (AMT 800 and AMT 10) Also 25 unfinished tunnels were found in the Jonas Valley. However on the adjacent German proving ground  experimental test sites were found for Nuclear weapons. remains were found, witnesses interviewed and entrances to large underground facilities were found and investigated by US army personnel, later documented by various Intelligence agencies and military Intelligence, OSS and ALSOS teams. Including the FULL report of the ALSOS teams findings at the nearby and related Nuclear Reactor site at the school building in Stadt-Ilm under command of Scientist Kurt Dibner. and actively covered before handing over of the area to the Russian army. The area was liberated April 4 1945 by the US army (4th Armored and 89th ID). I request all documentation of what was found, documented, filmed, inventoried and removed from these locations. This location was also under the command of SS General Hans Kammler. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request all the above information which in short is all information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer  Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel factories and Jonastal SIII. Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTino Von Struckmann",
