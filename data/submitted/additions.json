Therefore, I request that you provide access to the requested records as soon as possible and within the statutory time frame of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting that you waive any fees associated with this request, as I am a member of the public and this request is being made for a public purpose.\r\n\r\nI understand that your agency may charge a fee for the actual cost of duplication or retrieval of records, but I respectfully request that you waive any such fees in the interest of transparency and public access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
