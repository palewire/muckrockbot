As partygoers exited into the parking lot, multiple fights broke out, leading to the arrest of several juveniles and Jasmin Marie Watkins. Watkins was charged with rioting, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest for allegedly inciting the crowd and threatening an officer. Additional law enforcement agencies were called to assist, and pepper ball guns were noted as available to officers on the scene. Reports also indicated possible gunfire in the area.\r\nI am requesting copies of body-worn camera footage from officers who were present during the response, crowd dispersal, arrests, and any interactions with Jasmin Marie Watkins and the juveniles involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure.\r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tBody-worn camera footage\r\n\t\u2022\tDashcam recordings\r\n\t\u2022\t911 call recordings and transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tPolice dispatch logs\r\n\t\u2022\tArrest reports and investigative files\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal police communications related to the case\r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency.\r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt.\r\n\t\u2022\tACLU of Nevada v.

City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tState v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n4.

Arrest and Booking Reports\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tComplete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports.\r\n\t\u2022\tAfshar v.

Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.324(5)\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under:\r\n\t\u2022\t44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records).\r\n\t\u2022\t5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide:\r\n\t\u2022\tA written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked.\r\n\t\u2022\tAll segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing.

A data dictionary describing the properties present in the table, and how they relate to other records such as published incidents or arrests.\r\n3.

For the Grant Period 07/2024 - 12/2025 the NEA reports a grant of $1,146,200. \r\n\r\nThis N.E.A. money funds I.A.C. programs in various capacities. It can be inferred, for example, that at the city level, some of this funding is provided to the City of Evanston through the Evanston Arts Council (E.A.C.). \r\n\r\nThe specific breakdown of how these funds are divided up is not publicly available. The I.A.C. website instructs individuals to file a F.O.I.A. for cases where this information is desired. \r\n\r\nThat said, I request all communication between the Illinois Arts Council and the City of Evanston (including the E.A.C.) regarding grant money from June 2024 to the time that this request is processed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be greatly appreciated if you provided a detailed breakdown of N.E.A. funding allocated to the city of Evanston during this same time frame. \r\n\r\nIf applicable, I request that fees be waived as documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am requesting data starting in 2011 through the most recent year with full data availability in the system.\r\n\r\nFrom my research I believe that UTC data is administered by the FLHSMV based on the statutory authority 316.650, F.S. [found here: https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2017/316.650] and 322.20, F.S. [found here: http://m.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2018/322.20]. Based on information found in the Uniform Traffic Citation Procedures Manual [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/utccombinedmanual.pdf], the eCitation Interface Control Document [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/eCitation_Interface_Control_Document_6.1.pdf], the Traffic Citation Accounting Transmission System (TCATS) Interface Control Document (ICD) [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/tcats_icd_6_0_1.pdf] and the Uniform Traffic Citation Training presentation [found here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/pdf/courts/utc/2021_trcc_utc_grant_workshop.pdf] I understand UTC data is transmitted from issuing law enforcement agencies within five days of the offence date to the Florida Clerks of the Court (COC) for processing and are then validated and transferred via the Florida Court Clerks & Comptroller's Association (FCCC) Traffic Citation Accounting Transmission System (TCATS) to the FLHSMV within 10 days of disposition.\r\n\r\nMy request is for the validated UTC and disposition data that the FLHSMV currently has in its database(s).
