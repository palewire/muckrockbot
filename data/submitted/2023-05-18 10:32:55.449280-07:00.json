United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971): The Supreme Court recognized the need for government transparency and accountability, especially when matters of public concern are involved.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to draw your attention to a tweet posted by former President Donald Trump on October 6, 2020, in which he refers to the declaration or declassification of certain documents related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. For your reference, I have attached a screenshot of the tweet to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Here, you will find the list of all blocked profiles.\r\nGiven that these records relate to a public department's social media, which is utilized for communication with and among the public, they should fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to two cases related to social media blocking and the First Amendment. The first is Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump (2017), where the court found that blocking users from an official's Twitter account, which is used as a public forum, is a violation of their First Amendment rights. The second is Davison v. Randall (2019), where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended this reasoning to local officials.\r\n\r\nWhile these cases deal with blocking individuals on Twitter, they provide the legal context under which public officials and departments must operate when considering whether to block individuals from their social media accounts.\r\n\r\nGiven these precedents, the block list of the Ossining Police Department's Twitter account should constitute disclosable public records under the FOIA as they pertain to potential infringements on First Amendment activity.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. If records going back this far are not available, I ask that you provide records for as many years as possible.\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am an academic researcher and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish a paper in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nM",
