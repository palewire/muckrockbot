All of these are of interest and should be provided in separate video files where possible.\r\n\u2022 While recordings from the sensors of the MQ-9 Reaper drone publicly credited with the launch of missiles is of interest, I also request any footage from any separate UAV's in the operation (e.g., an Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance UAV used to observe the area immediately before and after the strike).\r\n\u2022 Any audio-video recordings from communications related to the recordings (for instance, audio of pilots and sensor operators coordinating) should also be released.\r\n\r\nI am requesting this review and release because I believe it contains information that is of public interest and does not pose a threat to national security if released.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide an estimated timetable for the review.

Specifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Energy Ant mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as all records related to DOE's decision to create a mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Energy Ant-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Energy Ant costume. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all correspondence related to Energy Ant (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007. Iowa Senator Jodi Ernst may also have sent responsive records.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all records related to any decision by DOE to stop using Energy Ant as part of its public outreach.\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a non-commercial project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
