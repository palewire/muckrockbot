His death is widely-known and widely reported; as\r\n    such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any\r\n    concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times\r\n    obituary at the following link:\r\n    https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/us/politics/joseph-i-lieberman-dead.html\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant\r\n    names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not\r\n    limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a\r\n    cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any\r\n    information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to\r\n    137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.
