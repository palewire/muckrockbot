I have significantly less patience after the incorrect closure of my appeal, that was downright rude.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am seeking copies of user/driver operating instructions, service manuals, service bulletins, and contract/design specifications, for the following subway cars, by rough order of fleet size:\r\nR46\r\nR62\r\nR62A\r\nR68\r\nR68A\r\nR142\r\nR142A\r\nR143\r\nR160\r\nR188\r\nR179\r\nR211A\r\nAnd the following buses, by rough order of introduction:\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 3rd Generation\r\nOrion Bus Industries Orion VII 07.501 EPA10 3rd Generation\r\nNew Flyer XD40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer C40LF Low Floor\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 1st Generation articulated\r\nNew Flyer XD60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNova Bus.LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XN40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer XN60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 4nd Generation articulated\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\n\r\nI do *not* need individual service requests, tickets, repair records, or similar information that is unique to each chassis.\r\n\r\nExamples of relevant documents, but by no means the only documents, specifically mentioned as furnished digitally to the MTA from the specification:\r\nTrain Operator's Manual\r\nRoad Car Inspector's Troubleshooting Manual\r\nWork Manual/Inspection Procedures \r\nOverhaul Manuals\r\nMaintenance and Engineering Instruction Manuals  \r\nInstructor Guides\r\nTraining Participant Guides\r\nTraining Aids (videos only)\r\nIllustrated Parts Catalogs (should these be available digitally)\r\n\r\nI do not have any interest in Operator Training Simulators, Special Presentation Equipment/Workstations, Special Tools and Test Equipment Manuals\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the request to only the portions of such records that are related to the HVAC system of vehicles. That's really what I'm interested in. Anything else would've simply been neat.\r\n\r\nSome of these vehicles have been in service for substantially longer than I've been alive. If any potentially responsive records more than 20 years or so old are not easily retrievable or searchable, you may absolutely narrow the search to the past 20 years, or any other reasonable periods of time which might be easily retrievable.\r\n\r\nDo not merely deny the request because the agency is large and may have records stored in different places - work with me. This does not need to be a waste of each other's time, we can go back and forth to construct a narrower request in good faith.\r\n\r\nI believe it is entirely unreasonable to withold, in blanket, the entire category of manuals and service bulletins, let alone the entire request, on the grounds of public safety. The case cited was a case of counterterrorism surveillance in a national security context that may have involved the disclosure of sources, methods, and targets. I think it should be obvious why I do not expect the operating manuals and service bulletins to contain information about sources, methods, and targets, of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe idea that mere information of the normal daily workings of mass transit vehicles in public hands is a threat to public safety flies in the face of good security practice (\"security through obscurity\" universally serves to perpetuate embarrassingly poor practices), but also is out of line with other industry practices. As an example, the full crew operations and instruction manuals for every mass produced passenger airliner is freely available to all, on the web, because the aviation industry has a proper understanding of safety and security.\r\n\r\nAs an example of why I believe this is unreasonable in the specific case of transit disruptions, I expect details of the locks and security systems of unattended signal huts to be of greater sensitivity than, for example, the operating instructions for the air-conditioning of a subway car. If these two examples were contained in the same \"record\" I'd reasonably expect the agency to redact the sensitive language rather than refuse disclosure of the entire record.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I have considerable reason to believe that said operation of the HVAC has been in a manner that is harmful to the lives and safety of new yorkers during an airborne pandemic that's already claimed the lives of several tens of thousands of said new yorkers. The disclosure of such information would likely contribute to the increased safety of new yorkers, and reduce disease related disrupts of all sorts in the system\u2026 including disruptions of the sort that have caused numerous sudden staffing shortages for the agency.\r\n\r\nYou cannot reasonably claim information about the HVAC system is an opportunity for terrorists or bad actors. An opportunity for what? To cause death and destruction by making subway cars slightly warmer than the already sizzling summer temperatures? Or cause grievous injuries by... Turning the fans up slightly?\r\n\r\nIf you're *really* honestly concerned that the 10ish buttons and a lever that operate the older model trains are so inherently unsafe and poorly secured that knowing which button (*clearly labeled in the cab*)  is responsible for each function ahead of time is sufficient to endanger the lives of New Yorkers...\r\n\r\nIf you deny the request, then your denial out of concern here indicates a much larger and more embarrassing problem for the MTA: the information that's already in the public domain, including in the form of specifications published by the MTA itself, is far more detailed than is sufficient to do any number of acts of sabotage or worse. \r\n\r\nI am looking right now at a 659 page specifications document published by the MTA that covers more than 200 currently-in-service train cars. It describes everything from the positive detents in the master control (maximum power through emergency brake and shut down), an exact description of the No-Motion Bypass switch, a detailed description (with graphics!) of trainline and car networks, and descriptions of the valves used to disable friction brakes. \r\n\r\nThat is required by law, to enable open bidding on agency contracts - it's an anti-corruption measure that's been in place for generations before me.\r\n\r\nAcross the rest of the internet, there are closeups of the keys used by the MTA to operate equipment like the Master Door Controller and also crew keys and subsequent replacements. I suspect the MDC key is actually the same design as the square key used to open many spigots. Yes, I too had trouble believing the \"the NYCT's standard, square-type, MDC key\" was literally a square key. It seems to be exactly specified in this patent:\r\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US4611104A/en\r\n\r\nIf you still believe there is a security risk involved here, clearly articulate it so that I may adjust the request to avoid a security risk. Anything else is sufficiently vague to deny access to most requests as a form of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of great, however quiet, controversy where the public declarations of political figures are in great disagreement with the direct measurement of dozens of volunteers on the ground, and it's important to be in possession of the full breadth of circumstances that determine the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nI am open to further narrowing the request if the agency records officers will provide guidance and suggestions as to what they can easily retrieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final communication in which my request was improperly closed is included below for your convenience:\r\nRE: FOIL Records Request of June 14, 2023, Reference # R000094-061423.\r\nDear Alexander Riccio,\r\nThe NYS Metropolitan Transit Authority received a FOIL request from you on June 14, 2023. You requested: \"Copies of user/driver operating instructions, service manuals, and service bulletins for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system.\"\r\nPlease be advised that your request for \"user/driver operating instructions\" for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars and buses in the system is denied pursuant to New York Public Officers Law (\u201cNYPOL\u201d) \u00a787(2)(f),  which permits the nondisclosure of information if it would pose a danger to the life or safety of any person. T he records you requested are exempt from FOIL disclosure as they are safety/security sensitive material that can be used to disrupt NYCT operations, threatening the lives and safety of NYCT customers and passengers and the general public. Release of the requested security-sensitive records would pose a security risk in that, public dissemination of the subject records could potentially be exploited by terrorists/bad actors, which could create \u201ca possibility of endangerment.\u201d See Matter of Asian Am. Legal Defense & Educ. Fund v. New York City Police Dept. , 125 A.D.3d 531, 532, 5 N.Y.S. 3d 13, 15, 2015 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 1550, *3, 2015 NY Slip Op 01559, 2.\r\nAdditionally, please be advised that your request for \"service bulletins for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system\" is overly broad and vague. Pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), FOIL requests must be reasonably described so that the agency may locate the records in question. Currently, the description you provided does not allow for practical retrieval by the agency. Specifically, your request fails to provide sufficient information for the agency to identify and locate responsive records, and would require the agency to \"engage in herculean efforts\" to locate records, which we are not required to do (See FOI-AO-18863). You may resubmit your request by providing a narrower timeframe and additional details to narrow down the specific records you are seeking.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to file an appeal regarding this determination, you may do so within thirty (30) days from this correspondence by sending a written appeal to: Chief Safety and Security Officer, Patrick Warren, MTA Headquarters, 2 Broadway, New York, NY 10004.\r\nSincerely,\r\nNYS Metropolitan Transit Authority\r\n\r\nFrom: ALEXANDER RICCIO\r\n\r\n08/24/2023\r\nSubject: RE: New York Freedom of Information Law Request #R000094-061423\r\n\r\nMail\r\nI I'd like to amend my request to narrow it.\r\n\r\nInstead of \"all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system\", you may only include the following:\r\n\r\nSubway, by rough order of fleet size:\r\nR44\r\nR46\r\nR62\r\nR62A\r\nR68\r\nR68A\r\nR142\r\nR142A\r\nR143\r\nR160\r\nR188\r\nR179\r\nR211A\r\nBuses, by rough order of introduction:\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 3rd Generation\r\nOrion Bus Industries Orion VII 07.501 EPA10 3rd Generation\r\nNew Flyer XD40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer C40LF Low Floor\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 1st Generation articulated\r\nNew Flyer XD60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNova Bus.LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XN40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer XN60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 4nd Generation articulated\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\n\r\nI do *not* need individual service requests, tickets, repair records, or similar information that is unique to each chassis.\r\n\r\nSome of these vehicles have been in service for substantially longer than I've been alive.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

These requests have been combined into one request, 60877. Please note, 60878 was closed. \nYour request 60877 has been placed on-hold for fees and clarification related reasons. \nDue to unusual circumstances, the request involves a \"voluminous\" amount of records that must be located, compiled, and reviewed, we are unable to process your request in the statutory required 20 working days and will need an extension of 10 working days.\u00a0 Additionally, at this time, we have determined that more than 10,000 pages are necessary to respond to your request, and we will still charge all accrued fees at the completion of the processing of your request. \nWe would like to provide you with an opportunity to modify the scope of your request (revise search terms to less broad terms), narrow down email custodians to key decision-making personnel, and/or arrange an alternative time period for processing the request.\u00a0 Please understand that the provided scope of custodians and search terms are going to delay processing by years and also result in a lot of unnecessary records that will be searched for relevancy and responsiveness.\u00a0 We need more clarity on what records you seek to find, in order to provide materials sooner. \nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact me, Qianna Norman, at Qianna.Norman@nih.gov.\u00a0 If you insist on keeping the request as written, it will remain on a \u201cfee-related hold\u201d until we determine a monetary amount of pre-payment that you will need to pay in order to start processing your request. \nPlease provide a response no later than, Friday October 27, 2023 to this email. \nI look forward to hearing from you. Thank you. \nSincerely, \n\nQianna Norman \nGovernment Information Specialist \nNHLBI",

For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, on behalf of Targeted Justice Inc.\r\nI request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to Targeted Justice:\r\n1.\tAll documents containing all the identities removed from the Terrorist Screening Database\u2019s Handling Codes 3 and 4 due to the person\u2019s death, including date of removal. \r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has almost 10,000 subscribers and over 115,000 thousands views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX  77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",
