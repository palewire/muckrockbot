        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nMonthly electronic listings of all employees of the Louisiana Executive Branch from January 1, 2019 to the present. Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

In response to your public records request, the Office of State Uniform Payroll has produced several spreadsheets, which can be accessed using the following DropBox link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/jhn4dw20nhs8he5/AAC7fSDwEij-wSXtdvcsTNo5a?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe information provided is for employees of executive branch agencies paid through the LaGov HCM payroll system.  This does not include higher education or agencies in the legislative and judicial branches of government.\r\n\r\nThe worksheets are sorted by Agency Number. The Agency Name Reference workbook contains a mapping of personnel area (PA) number (agency) to personnel area text (agency name). The first three (3) characters in the name represent the department.\r\n\r\nThere may be employees on the Demographic worksheets and not on the Race_Gender_Work Parish worksheets. This is because the position does not have a work parish specified and thus they are excluded from the report used to gather this information.\r\n\r\nWith this production, the Division of Administration considers your public records request satisfied and will close its file.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Requests\r\nDivision of Administration\r\nState of Louisiana\r\nEmail: doapublicrecords@la.gov<mailto:doapublicrecords@la.gov>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Owens:\r\n\r\nThis email is in response to your request for public records dated March 7, 2023, to the City Clerk of the City of Elizabeth pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq. (OPRA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou sought the following records:\r\n\r\n  1.  Incident-level data on Elizabeth (NJ) Police Department [EPD] officers\u2019 drawing their weapons/firearms in the course of their duty [\u2026] from years 2000 to 2020, including the time, date, and street address (e.g. 123 Main St) for all incidents where an officer drew their weapon/firearm;\r\n  2.  Incident-level data on [EPD] officers\u2019 discharging their weapons/firearms in the course of their duty [\u2026] from years 2000 to 2020, including the time, date, and street address (e.g. 123 Main St) for all incidents where an officer discharged their firearm;\r\n  3.  If incident-level data on the [EPD] officers\u2019 discharging their firearms in the course of their duty from years 2000 to 2020 inclusive is available, [you requested] associated data on whether the shootings by the officers were lethal (i.e. suspects or civilians died as a result of gunshots\u2019 from officers\u2019 weapons) or non-lethal (i.e. suspects or civilians were shot but did not die); and\r\n  4.  Demographic data on the officers and suspects or civilians involved in each incident of [EPD] officers drawing, discharging, and/or striking (lethal and non-lethal) of suspects or civilians.\r\n\r\nRegarding all four of your data requests, please be advised that no responsive records exist from 2000-2006. From 2007 until May 2015, all use of force reports with the requested information are stored in scanned PDF form. There is no way to collate the data besides recording it one-by-one, which requires the custodian to conduct research and create a new record, which she is not required to do under OPRA. From May 2015 to September 2020, the use of force reports have been archived as the EPD no longer uses the system the reports were originally stored in. At this time, we are still determining if the data for these records can be collated into easily generated data. Please allow the City\u2019s custodian additional time of seven (7) business days to investigate further.\r\n\r\nFor the year 2020, all of the data requested for 2020 to present is readily available on the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s website (https://www.njoag.gov/force/). Once you follow the link, you must scroll down and click \u201cAccess Use of Force Dashboard\u201d. From there, you are able to search for the EPD and the requested types of force and demographics and find the records you are searching for. EPD inputs this information directly to the State, so records for 2020 will be identical to those found on the State dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience, I will reach back out with the status of the 2007-May 2015 data shortly.\r\n\r\n\nAll the best,\r\n\r\n\r\nSamantha J. Castrelos, Esq.\r\nSpecial Counsel\r\nCity of Elizabeth, Law Department\r\n50 Winfield Scott Plaza, Room 201\r\nElizabeth, New Jersey 07201\r\n(908) 820-4009",

It's very helpful.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of force reports from 2007 though mid-2015 that are are only available via PDF, may I request copies of the PDFs of the reports? That would meet my initial request that whatever I receive be \"filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.\" It also would mean that there'd be no need for the custodian to do any research, and there'd be no need for a new record to be created create collation. The same would be true if I the reports from mid-May 2015 through 2019 were PDFs, too.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you.",

I actually misspoke in my last email when I said they were stored as scanned PDFs. They are actually stored as hard copies but we can scan and send over. However we still need to review each report as sometimes the civilians are minors so their identities will need to be redacted. Is there a time frame in which you need to receive all records by? We can begin this process but it does take some time for review and we can send over on a rolling basis if there is no rush. Please advise.\nThank you,\r\nSamantha",

If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 138 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 571 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,289 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,649 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nF: (540) 868-4391\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Olympia School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide these records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent records to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

We received your email requesting clarification\r\nabout our methodology in responding to your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we detailed to you in a previous communication, many of our public\r\nrecords requests concern students and staff. We have approximately 136\r\npublic records requests that are responsive to your request that require 3rd\r\nparty notification related to hundreds of people.\r\n                                           2020-2021- 28 requests require 3\r\nrd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2018-2019 \u2013 13\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2012-2017 \u2013 95\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7       With our last installment, we have provided to you, in reverse\r\nchronological order, all requests for records covering 2012-2021 that do\r\nnot require 3rd party notification.  Next we will be providing non-exempt\r\nrecords responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       After those installments, we will move on to the requests that\r\nrequire 3rd party notification, allowing time for affected parties to seek\r\ninjunctions if they so choose.  Absent injunctions, we will then provide\r\nnon-exempt records responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our responsive records are available electronically, but many from\r\n2012 \u2013 2017 are in paper form and will need to be scanned into PDFs.\r\nEmails are printed and then scanned to PDF for production.  We are making\r\nsteady progress in fulfilling your request but are unable to give an exact\r\ndate when the request will be completed in full.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiana S.

In addition, I am requesting copies of the grants for FY 22, 23, and 24 for the Wayne County indigent defense system. \r\n\r\nI am also requesting any additional correspondence or materials regarding Wayne County's noncompliance with Standard 5, compliance with which was mandated by April 2022.\" \r\nYour request is granted. \r\nThe estimated cost of continuing to process your request is $93.06. Please refer to the attached Detailed Itemization Form for a breakdown of the fees. Failure to charge would result in an unreasonably high cost to the Department in this particular instance because the employees must be taken away from pending work to process the request, and expend additional time to complete regularly assigned departmental work. \r\nSection 4(8) of the FOIA, MCL 15.234(8), provides that a public body may require a good-faith deposit of one-half of the estimated FOIA processing fee. Upon the FOIA Office\u2019s receipt of a payment for one-half of the above-stated amount, the request will be processed within an estimated 15 business days. Further, upon completing the processing of the request, the Department will send notice of the balance due, the statutory basis for exemptions, if any, and the statutory remedial rights, if applicable. After receipt of the fee balance, copies of the records will be provided to you within five business days. To avoid processing delays, please only pay the amount shown on the invoice (half of the total estimated fees). \r\nSection 4(8) of the FOIA, MCL 15.234(8), provides that the time frame estimate is nonbinding upon the public body, but the public body shall provide the estimate in good faith and strive to be reasonably accurate and provide the records in a manner based on this state\u2019s public policy set forth in section 1(2) of the FOIA, MCL 15.231(2), and the nature of the request in the particular instance. \r\nThe invoice that contains the detailed itemization of fees is ready and available at the FOIA Center  . \r\nIf you wish to discuss possible ways to reduce the costs, please contact us at . (mailto:larafoiainfo@michigan.gov) larafoiainfo@michigan.gov \r\nPayment can be submitted online or by mail \u2013 \r\n\u2022\u00a0To pay online, visit the following link: FOIA Payment Center . \r\n\u2022To pay by check or money order (via mail), send the check or money order, made payable to the State of Michigan to P.O. Box 30004, Lansing, MI 48909. To ensure proper credit, please enclose a copy of the invoice included with this correspondence and include the FOIA request number on the check or money order. \r\nPlease note that, if payment is not received within 48 calendar days after this notice is sent, your request may be considered as abandoned under MCL 15.234(14). \r\nIf you have questions concerning this matter, please email us at .

This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

We are in the process of analyzing the request.\r\n\r\nOIG gives public records requests high priority and provides requested records as soon as practicable and without delay. A reasonable time for response to a specific public record request depends on the nature of the request, the staff and other resources available to process the request, the extent of the request, and whether confidential material contained in the responsive records must be redacted.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(3), the Department may charge for locating records if the cost is $50 or more, as well as the costs of copies or scanning and mailing/shipping the records responsive to the request. We will prepare an estimate for the cost of the requested documents, if any, and will submit an invoice to you before compiling the records. Also, under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(3)(f), OIG will require prepayment of the estimated cost of providing a copy of the records to you if the total cost exceeds $5.\r\n\r\nYou may direct any questions concerning this request to dhsoigopenrecordsrequest@wi.gov<mailto:dhsoigopenrecordsrequest@wi.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony J.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to and copies of records related to the Central Park Five case. This case is of great public interest as it involved the wrongful convictions of five teenagers - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise - for the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a female jogger, in Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. The case garnered significant media attention and raised serious concerns about the criminal justice system, police tactics, and racial bias. The convictions were later vacated in 2002, and a settlement was reached with the City of New York in 2014.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking the following records:\r\n\r\nAll internal memos, emails, and communications related to the investigation of the Central Park Five case.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise, including but not limited to police reports, witness statements, interrogation records, and forensic evidence.\r\nAll records of any internal investigations, disciplinary actions, or reviews related to the handling of the Central Park Five case, including any assessments or evaluations of the tactics employed during the investigation and interrogation process.\r\nAny documents or records that detail the settlement and/or restitution process for Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation and prosecution of Matias Reyes, whose confession and DNA evidence ultimately led to the exoneration of the Central Park Five.\r\nAny other relevant documents, records, or files that pertain to the Central Park Five case.\r\nI request that you provide these records without redaction or withholding, as the requested documents are of significant public interest and concern. If any information is withheld or redacted, please provide a written explanation for the denial, citing the specific exemption(s) under FOIL that justify the withholding or redaction. As established in numerous FOIL cases, including Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Department (89 N.Y.2d 267) and Matter of Fink v. Lefkowitz (47 N.Y.2d 567), the burden of proof for denying access to requested documents falls on the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that I intend to exhaust all administrative remedies and may seek judicial review under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules if access to the requested documents is denied or if there is an unreasonable delay in providing the requested documents.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need clarification regarding this request, please   feel free to reach out  for clarfication\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am writing to request payroll records (for all employees of your institution) from 1984 to 2022. The information I am looking for is nonpersonal (ie: Name, campus address and telephone number, title, rate of pay, job description and date of hire). We would like disaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with more specificity, the information we are looking for: \r\n\r\nNon Personal records:\r\nName (first and last)\r\nEmail\r\nTitle\r\nRate of pay (base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, and total pay)\r\nJob description\r\nDate of hire\r\nIf the institution has a system of categorizing employees please include their categorization and corresponding codebook if relevant. \r\nDepartment and/or Area and/or Office \r\n\r\nTo the extent any of these records may not exist or may not be disclosed, please disclose any segregable parts of relevant documents.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGuest Access",

Therefore, I request that you provide access to the requested records as soon as possible and within the statutory time frame of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting that you waive any fees associated with this request, as I am a member of the public and this request is being made for a public purpose.\r\n\r\nI understand that your agency may charge a fee for the actual cost of duplication or retrieval of records, but I respectfully request that you waive any such fees in the interest of transparency and public access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
