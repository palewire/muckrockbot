Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

For instance, devices and access points purchased by your agency but never deployed or provided to anyone, lets say sitting on a shelf new in the box in an agency warehouse, would NOT be a responsive record requested.\r\n\r\nHowever a 5 year old my-fi hotspot provided to an agency employee, say a vice superintendent for working remotely from home WOULD be a responsive record requested.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nRELEVANT PORTION OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022.\r\n\r\n2. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021.\r\n\r\n3.

Please specifically task a search for C. Martinez and Joshua Farnkopf, Esq., as well as any FOIA talkers and responses sent or received by ICE FOIA between February 23, 2023, and April 5, 2023. Your request was received in this office on 4/6/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182.

Given the ongoing pandemic and the critical nature of vaccine safety, timely access to this information could be life-saving for individuals considering vaccination.\r\n\r\nUrgency to Inform the Public: The V-safe program involves actual federal government activity that is of urgent concern to the public. The sooner this information is released, the sooner the public can make informed decisions about their health.\r\n\r\nWidespread and Exceptional Media Interest: The COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts are subjects of exceptional media interest. The integrity of the V-safe program and how it has been managed could significantly affect public confidence in the government's handling of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nGiven these compelling reasons, I also request a rolling release of records as they become available. This would serve the public interest by providing critical information as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n",

We have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \r\n\r\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \r\n\r\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is access codes.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \r\nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nWe have redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 Individuals who go through an application process or examination process to attain a certain job or position have an expectation that this information would not be publicly disseminated if they are unsuccessful in attaining the position.\u00a0 In 2011 PAC 13060, the PAC cited to an earlier decision to explain why release of all information relating to all unsuccessful applicants is exempt.\u00a0 The PAC stated, \u201c\u2026the fact that an individual is seeking new employment for a position is information that a reasonable person would view as highly personal and the release of that information is likely to be viewed as objectionable by most individuals.\u00a0 Publication of an individual\u2019s application for a position can negatively impact that individual\u2019s current employment\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Also, in 2010 PAC 6243, the PAC held that the names of applicants who completed the Firefighter/EMT exam are exempt pursuant to Section 7(1)(c).\u00a0 Thus, the Mayor's Office has properly redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the Agency contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled into a single digital .pdf file.\r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available, or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully I decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite me to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

You will be asked to verify your email address and request a code in order to open the folder. This is a security feature that I am not able to override. If you are unable to receive a verification link email at 150701-33137398@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:150701-33137398@requests.muckrock.com> or do not find a code in your junk/span folder,  please provide another email address where you are able to receive the verification code.

However, King County did not review or produce Rhonda Berry's records for that request after the customer withdrew that portion of the request due to labor union objections to the release.\r\n\u200b\r\nOur preliminary estimate is that researching, reviewing and producing Rhonda Berry's email records could take multiple installments over the course of 5 or more years. Unlike the other employees listed, Berry was not an employee of the Department of Local Services - Permitting Division (formerly DPER.) The department director, John Starbard, reported to Berry, but she was not involved in the day-to-day work of the division.\r\n\u200b\r\n\u200bIn order to process these request items efficiently and expediently, please provide information for the following questions regarding Rhonda Berry's email records:\r\n\r\n  *   Are you seeking Berry's email records regarding specific permits and/or code enforcement cases?\r\n  *   Are you seeking records from a more specific time frame or date range?\r\n  *   Are you seeking Berry's email records sent to/from particular staff members, or departments?\r\n  *   Can you identify subjects or key words to help us locate the records you are seeking?\r\nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience about which types of Rhonda Berry records you are seeking.\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are currently gathering and reviewing records responsive to the remaining portions of your request, for the records of other employees that you listed. We anticipate providing you an installment of responsive records on approximately 09/26/2023.\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\nGreg Felton\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nDLS-Permitting Division\r\nGreg.Felton@kingcounty.gov",

However, King County did not review or produce Rhonda Berry's records for that request after the customer withdrew that portion of the request due to labor union objections to the release. Our preliminary estimate is that researching, reviewing and producing Rhonda Berry's email records could take multiple installments over the course of 5 or more years. Berry was not an employee of the Department of Local Services - Permitting Division (formerly DPER.) The department director, John Starbard, reported to Berry, but she was not involved in the day-to-day work of the division. In order to process these request items efficiently and expediently, please provide information for the following questions regarding Rhonda Berry's email records: \r\n \r\n  *  Are you seeking Berry's email records regarding specific permits and/or code enforcement cases? \r\n  *  Are you seeking records from a more specific time frame or date range? \r\n  *  Are you seeking Berry's email records sent to/from particular staff members, or departments? Can you identify subjects or key words to help us locate the records you are seeking? Please contact me at your earliest convenience about which types of Rhonda Berry records you are seeking. We are currently gathering and reviewing records responsive to the remaining portions of your request, for the records of other employees that you listed. We anticipate providing you an installment of responsive records on approximately 09/26/2023. Sincerely, Greg Felton Public Records Officer DLS-Permitting Division  To monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Request System (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6HtRfOYLt5fXvpttM-2FU1HbCEvhyJajy29FOdQx-2FGVwa3heKW32oH6xOd0YvjOzCmm-2FiWbSEPJXEM9nE4rjPMHZ6jzFDDMRvkCY-2FQ0iWSMX0WdIxNqpirAEkY55GPE0kTCuQK9-2B1qnGR6EUQ15RblIQ-3D-3Dkoqy_-2BlMpHnWfZ0khxV1RaZbZ4mGtXSldq7B-2FTzCnSv7K7KoHdkME1saqlyIiN8fKohQ9rlvO-2BgPuCmBp1hrNfhLgKnGnH6KGYA4U8z1TytajrtEQ-2FXqkb5WAVOKYMdwViZCc5H3-2FnIqDG-2F50UAJLUUxlJOg-2Ftl6A6QHhZUOXD-2B3w3RmzwTrFpwMMu8oNJ6aY6Ic7fcAQ3HsMlLcUKb-2FYJqZoxvtgcc2tAku1Pa0SxRGwIksGsxdTBlCxH2IF-2FLdi4q3NJD7Wyj1SDr3QwgXnMO8qXprOb34UHqIT9Cg3VFeuhoXFbngK1nqVWcJpi-2FpczFEOT134H9Mm6fNMEkv3IojzRqPMtrLTpKtly-2FCdMg9MM1cM0sp3Rk0w9gYVuTTi1ym8YbEAXhC6U6tCmsFFkZPo8A-3D-3D)",

Of the thirty three (33) total installments you reference we have received \u201cPROD016,\u201d \u201cPROD017,\u201d \u201cPROD018\u201d and \u201cPreDISCOInstallments.\u201d The numbered installments seem self explanatory, the PreDISCOInstallments file requires explanation. Is the PreDISCOInstallments file 1 of the 33 total files?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is a little complicated and my keeping the original naming convention did not make it very clear. My record shows that there were 38 installments of records produced in response to the 2016 request. Of the 38 installments, 5 were produced by staff and the next 33 were produced with the assistance of the Discovery database. Each one of the installments from Discovery was labeled a production, or PROD. (So PROD 001 from Discovery was actually installment 6, overall.) The file labeled \u201cPreDISCOInstallments\u201d contains the records produced in the first 5 installments, prior to King County using the Discovery database to review and produce later installments. The database manufacturer refers to their software as \u201cDISCO,\u201d which I used when naming that file. So in actuality you will receive 33 \u201cproduction\u201d files and the file named \u201cPreDISCOInstallments\u201d for a total of 34 separate files.\r\n\r\nI could have renamed the PROD files to make it simpler, but keeping the original PROD names helped me stay organized and recognize the gaps in the records that I have available to me. We are still gathering the remaining productions from the DISCO database and I hope to get another batch to you within the next week.  I want to add that I did not receive a 9/7 email from you, so I apologize for the delay in responding to you. I don\u2019t see a message in a junk folder so I\u2019m not sure what happened.

        "communication": "CAUTION: This email and any attachments may contain Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regulations at 32 CFR Part 2002 apply to all executive branch agencies that designate or handle information that meets the standards for CUI.\r\n\r\nI'm working on FOIA request NLRB-2023-001998 for \"all non-exempt fields of the participant and participant_party tables from the NxGen case management system database.\"\r\n\r\nNxGen designates participants to have one of four roles:\r\n\r\n  *   Primary: This is usually the main address of the facility as designated on the charge or petition\r\n  *   Legal Rep: Legal representation for the primary participant\r\n  *   Additional Service: These are people who would be like a cc in letters,  or it could be a secondary address for someone.  For example: many union reps list their official business address as primary, and because they might be located in a remote area or working from home, they have a secondary address or home address listed as an additional service.\r\n  *   Notification: This are the national or international union headquarters.  To become a notification, the organization has to file Form 4702 annually, and the notification party only receives a copy of the charge or petition.\r\n\r\nParticipants also have distinct roles: Employer, Union, Individual, and Union as an Employer.\r\n\r\nNxGen further designates participants as: Charging Party, Charged Party/Respondent, Involved Party, Petitioner, Intervenor, Employer, and Amicus.\r\n\r\nInstead of providing a dump of all the participants in the system, and in order to provide the most relevant case information, my recommendation for participants is to provide the Primary participant information (entity name and address) and exclude the Legal Reps, Additional Services, and Notifications.  Also, because the participant tables do not contain any other case-specific information besides the case number, I would recommend including the case name, date filed, date closed, and case closing reason.

The first 5 digits of his Social Security Number were 090-44.\r\n\r\nInclude all records related to at least two aircraft known to be connected to Epstein: N908JE (registered to JEGE INC) ; N909JE (registration unknown); and N212JE (registered to JEGE LLC and PLAN D LLC).  Include all inquiries to the FAA and answers from the FAA for information requests on Epstein or the listed aircraft from a U.S. Cabinet Department (e.g., Department of Justice),  federal agency (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation), or from a state or local law enforcement agency (e.g., NYPD).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. FAA systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to): DOT/FAA 801 \u2013 Aircraft Registration Records; DOT/FAA 813 - Civil Aviation Security System; DOT/FAA 815 - Investigative Record System; DOT/FAA 845 - Administrators Correspondence Control and Hotline Information System, ACCIS, Administrator\u2019s Hotline Information System, AHIS, and Consumer Hotline Information System, CHIS; and DOT/FAA 847 - Aviation Records on Individuals. \r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that FAA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nEPSTEIN is widely reported to have died 8/10/2019 in New York City (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Epstein as a subject should thus be assumed free from FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nThere are several issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, what you are requesting is a very, very large search.  All records pertaining to Sea Launch, it\u2019s license, safety inspections, etc. is potentially thousands of dollars in search and review.  To the extent we can narrow down \u201call records mentioning or pertaining to\u201d on this licensee, that would help.\r\n\r\nSecondly, many of the records are physical, and again the search and duplication required will be substantial. In addition, our offices are currently closed to non-essential personnel due to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nOn the environmental documents, many of those were formally publicly available, so we are moving those to FAA FOIA Library.  When they are online, we can let you know.  There is no charge for those.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be unable to find responsive records in the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a system run by NASA.  ASRS records are voluntary reported and de-identified before they arrive to FAA systems.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to modify the scope, we will conduct a full estimate of the cost of the search for your review and approval.\r\n\r\nI have found that when working with the public, media, and others on scope issues, it\u2019s a lot easier to have conversation about it, and then follow up with an email for the record.  If you would like to do that, I\u2019m happy to talk.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Rushforth\r\nChief of Staff\r\nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation\r\nFederal Aviation Administration\r\n(202) 267-9617",

The records include emails regarding an investigation which is responsive to your request for \"Any records or emails pertaining to Amber Donovan that have anything to do with lewd texting and videos being sent to subordinates. Focusing in on her position as Custodial manager, Coordinator.
