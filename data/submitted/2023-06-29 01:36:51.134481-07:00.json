        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Mr. William Weyland Turner, aka William W. Turner, aka William Turner, aka Bill Turner (April 14, 1927 \u2013 December 26, 2015). Mr. Turner worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1951 and 1961, and wrote about his time as an agent in a number of non-fiction books, including \"Hoover's FBI\", and as an editor for Ramparts Magazine (100-HQ-445393). In the introduction to \"Hoover's FBI\", Mr. Turner states that the Bureau maintained a case file on him which he obtained in the late 1970s, circa 1978; from pages xvii and xviii of the 1993 edition of the book (ISBN-13: 9781560250630): \"When I obtained my FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) a decade later, the FBI's back-door collaboration with Joe Pyne was confirmed. Several days before the show, Pyne's producer had called the local FBI office soliciting 'any information on Turner' because there were 'some derogatory comments concerning the FBI' in the book. The Special Agent in Charge (SAC) immediately sent an 'Urgent' teletype to Washington headquarters urging that Pyne be furnished an abstract of my dossier. If this wasn't done, the SAC warned, 'IT MAY WRONGLY APPEAR THAT TURNER AND HIS ILK ARE PARAGONS OF TRUTH, VERACITY AND COMPETENCY TO JUDGE.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Turner's privacy, as he passed away on December 26, 2015. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Turner's obituary in The Mercury News, out of San Jose, California. For clarity's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/01/06/william-turner-bay-area-fbi-agent-who-criticized-j-edgar-hoover-dies-at-88/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Turner publicly disclosed his work with the the Bureau in this memoir and in articles for publications like Ramparts Magazine and The Nation, removing any further concerns over privacy. That he wrote extensively about his time as an agent with the Bureau would make him a figure of public interest.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Philly Voice, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to Bureau policies on monitoring former agents. Mr. Turner engaged in a very public dispute with then-director J. Edgar Hoover after his termination in 1961, and given that Mr. Turner himself identified a Bureau file or files showing Bureau surveillance, it would be in the public interest for any Bureau files germane to Mr. Turner to be made public so that this era in the Bureau's history can be better understood and contextualized.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Federal Aviation Administration:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to FAA's aviation education mascot, Air Bear.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Air Bear mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to FWS's decision to create a mascot in the first place. (According to FAA records (attached), Air Bear was conceived of by Janice Draper of the Illinois Division of Aeronautics, and FAA adopted Air Bear as its official aviation education mascot in early 1989.) \r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Air Bear-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books). (According to FAA records (attached), these records include coloring books, classroom materials, and a video called \"Air Bear Goes On A Trip.\")\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Air Bear costume (pictured in the attached FAA records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Air Bear.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Air Bear (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by FAA to stop using Air Bear as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

He then worked for General Edward Lansdale as a member of the State Department in South Vietnam for two years. Ellsberg contributed to a top-secret study on the Vietnam War, known as the \"Pentagon Papers,\"  commissioned by Defense Secretary McNamara in 1967 and 1968.  Ellsberg later became famous for leaking this study to the press in 1971.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the documents on Ellsberg are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
