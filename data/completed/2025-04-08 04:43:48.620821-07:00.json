However, in the unlikely case that your agency only maintains records in paper format and therefore a paper copy is appropriate, one would expect a reasonable charge of $0.05 per page (as is standard among state agencies).  If we account for $3 for postage, and double the fee to $.10 a page, that would indicate your policy is 70 pages long, which seems extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, please provide an accounting of what the fee is for so I may assess whether this fee does not exceed the cost to you.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nDave Maass\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns the January 29, 2025 \"MEMORANDUM FOR SENIOR PENTAGON LEADERSHIP COMMANDERS OF THE COMBATANT COMMANDS DEFENSE AGENCY AND DOD FIELD ACTIVITY DIRECTORS,\" entitled \"Restoring America's Fighting Force,\" issued by the Secretary of Defense. A copy of the memo is available at https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/29/2003634987/-1/-1/1/RESTORING-AMERICAS-FIGHTING-FORCE.PDF.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of the \"initial report\" by the Task Force to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The initial report was due on or before March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Secretary's creation of a task force and the initial report by the task force.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback on the \"initial report\" may impact the Task Force's final report, which is due on June 1, 2025. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nb. https://www.dailywire.com/news/pentagon-guts-dei-programs-from-u-s-military\r\nc. https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\nd. https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/01/hegseth-sets-up-pentagon-task-force-to-roll-back-diversity-programs-00201320\r\ne. https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nf. https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\ng https://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Department itself published an article concerning the Task Force, reflecting its recognition that there is a public interest in timely information about it: https://www.defense.gov/news/news-stories/article/article/4047592/defense-secretary-directs-creation-of-task-force-to-restore-americas-fighting-f/\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

According to a document released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Ronin 3.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Ronin 3,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

This includes communications to provide the Virginia Mercury, Cardinal News and the Washington Post  Maj. Gen. Win's statement of March 6, 2025, Mr. Watjen's resignation letter, and the email to the VMI Faculty, staff, cadets, VMI Alumni Agencies, etc. of Maj. Gen. Wins' statement and other matters related to the subject and any fees charged. I am willing to accept incremental delivery. At the minimum, VMI should be able to provide the communications involving how the Washington Post became aware of, requested, and provided Mr. Watjen's resignation letter and the Superintendent's Statement on the BOV decision not to renew his contract immediately, as these stories were just published recently with those documents. For the purposes of this FOIA,  the Washington Post records do not include any of those already provided in my previous FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The timeframe requested is limited to reduce burden and focuses only on video directly tied to this incident. \r\n\r\nIf necessary, I consent to redactions in accordance with Florida law and request the release of all non-exempt portions. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically:\r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above.

I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
