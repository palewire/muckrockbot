A uniformed security patrol officer in a Citiguard vehicle approached them. The security officer asks them to stop recording and leave property, and then appears to initiate a vehicle pursuit in a Citiguard marked patrol vehicle on public roads that reach reported speeds of 70mph to 100mph. According to BSIS's website, Citiguard's owner is GHARZAI NOMAIR, and Citiguard has two  previous citations for employing non-licensed security officers. \r\n\r\nAs such, I am requesting the following:\r\n1) Citiguard's License, Certificates, or other verification documents that indicate their authority to work in California City, CA\r\n2) Citiguard's current Private Patrol Operator application and/or most recent renewal application, packet, or documentation submitted to achieve BSIS licensure for license 121572, and for any branch or other licenses that permit Citiguard's operations within California City, CA. \r\n3) Any complaints, investigations, notices, or tips related to Citiguard from January 2024 through the date of completion of this request \r\n4) Any emails that your office has received or sent relating to the September 2nd, 2025 incident involving Citiguard at the CoreCivic Detention Center\r\n5) Any Citiguard policies relating to foot or vehicle pursuits, use of force continuum, verbal de-escalation, or patrol SOPs that are in your possession\r\n\r\nThis is a newsworthy event, I respectfully request that you expedite this request to the extent possible. You may send documents as they become available. I appreciate you taking the time to fulfil this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Any communications between Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin and Georgetown University, Georgetown University Law Center, or William M.\u00a0Treanor\u00a0 between February 1, 2025 and May 8, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely a United States Attorney's initiation of an \"inquiry\" into the academic content of courses at a private law school.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nb. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nc. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\nd. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\ne. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\nf. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\ng. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\nh. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\ni. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nj. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nk. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nl. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nm. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\nn. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\no. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\np. https://www.foxnews.com/media/georgetown-professors-slam-trumps-dei-crackdown-attack-religious-freedom-jesuit-schools\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum. This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on a law school to limit viewpoints offered in classroom teaching protected by the First Amendment. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry.\" Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

        "communication": "Greetings,\r\n\r\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office has received your request for public records and is processing your request. All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2179. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov<mailto:mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov> and include your tracking #.\r\n\r\n***Pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCalbert Gillett\r\n[Sent from Front]\n",

I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't of the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations of HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I also request that you release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of any records. Please provide a Vaughn Index if you withhold information.\r\n\r\nThis request is for all documents produced between 08/01/2025 and the time this request is processed.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: I request a full waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by revealing how taxpayer funds are being obligated through the federal procurement process. It is not primarily in my commercial interest. I am a journalist with The Latino Newsletter, a new media outlet focused on reporting about Puerto Rico (thelatinonewsletter.org).\r\n\r\nIf you deny this fee waiver request, I am willing to pay up to $50 in fees. Please inform me if the total fees will exceed this amount before proceeding with processing my request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii), I respectfully request expedited processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling need for this information because its disclosure is urgently necessary to inform the public concerning actual or alleged government activity, and it concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Homeland Security is at the forefront of national issues receiving intense public and legislative scrutiny, including border security, immigration enforcement, and cybersecurity. The award of contract 70CDCR24FR0000036 involves the obligation of substantial public funds for services and capabilities that directly impact these critical DHS missions.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread and urgent public desire to understand how DHS is spending taxpayer money, the nature of the services it is procuring, and the companies it is partnering with to execute its vital duties. The release of this information is essential for ensuring government transparency and accountability. Delaying its release would significantly impair the public's ability to engage in a timely and informed manner on these matters of ongoing national debate and current exigency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of all agreements, contracts, performance work statements, requests for proposal, and clarifications between ICE and CoreCivic allowing the company to reopen and operate what is now known as the California City Immigration Processing Center in California City California. Some or all of these arrangements may fall within Contract ID 70CDCR25D00000010 and/or\r\n70CDCR25FR0000039. \r\n\r\n2. A copy of all written communications between ICE and CoreCivic pertaining to the records listed in Item 1 above for the period beginning March 1, 2024, and continuing through the date the agency tasks an adequate search responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of all facility inspections ICE or any entity acting on ICE's behalf performed of the California City Immigrant Processing Center to ascertain the condition of the facility and whether it comports with federal standards, as well as any working papers created as part of these inspections and any communications between ICE and CoreCivic or any entity acting on ICE's behalf and CoreCivic pertaining to these inspections. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of all invoices CoreCivic sent to ICE for pertaining to the contracts described in Item 1 above. \r\n\r\n5. A copy of the ICE-approved facility handbook for the California City Immigrant Processing Center. \r\n\r\n6. Any communications between ICE and California City officials regarding its plan to reopen the Cal City prison during the period beginning December 1, 2024, and continuing through the date the agency tasks an adequate search responsive to this request. \r\n\r\n7. Any communications or agreements between ICE and the US Marshals regarding collaboration, coordination, or assistance between the Marshals and ICE in helping CoreCivic reopen the Cal City Prison. \r\n\r\nAn adequate search responsive to this request will task, at minimum, the ICE Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ), ICE Office of Detention Oversight (ODO), ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, and ICE's Office of the Acting Director. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements in support of this request are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination. My edited work has appeared in The Intercept, The Appeal, and the Atlanta Community Press Collective. \r\n2. There is an urgent need to inform the public of the contractual and oversight decisions ICE and CoreCivic have reached regarding the Cal City prison facility. \r\n3. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), ICE has not posted a copy of its contract with CoreCivic for the operation of the Cal City prison facility. See www.ice.gov/FOIA/library (generating no results for contracts pertaining to Cal City). \r\n4. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of FOIA, ICE has not posted a copy of any inspection it conducted for the Cal City prison. \r\n5. At present, contrary to its existing practice and obligations under federal appropriations requirements and the affirmative disclosure provisions of FOIA, ICE has not listed any detention statistics for the Cal City prison in its August 29, 2025, Detention Statistics disclosure, despite confirmed reports that ICE transferred noncitizens to the facility up to a week prior to releasing those figures. \r\n6. The Cal City prison is currently operating without a valid business license. \r\n7. The Cal City prison failed the pre-licensing fire inspection, and was deemed to dangerous to safely conduct business. \r\n8. The Cal City prison is currently operating without a valid Conditional Use Permit. \r\n9. The Cal City prison is currently operating in contravention of SB29, a California statute, CoreCivic and ICE challenged and lost the fight to strike down at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Consequently, ICE and CoreCivic are violating the mandate in that case by operating Cal City in contravention of SB29. \r\n10. Conditions inside the Cal City prison are unconstitutionally punitive, according to reports from noncitizens currently housed there, in violation of the Ninth Circuit's King v. Los Angeles County. Detained immigrants transferred to the facility from other sites of ICE detention report being subjected to prison-like conditions of confinement, punitive searches, denial of medication, and lack of access to basic, legally required services, such as a law library and outdoor recreation. \r\n11. The location of the Cal City prison makes it particularly risky to transfer noncitizens there for detention who share certain genetic phenotypes because of their susceptibility and lack of immunity to Valley Fever, placing medically vulnerable detained immigrants at heightened risk for serious harm, and imposing serious strains on the local health and emergency response system. \r\n12. The Cal City prison was a site of multiple preventable deaths during CoreCivic's prior operation pursuant contracts with the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, including multiple drug overdoses, and prior to that, when the facility was being used by the Marshals and ICE, at least three apparent deaths in custody by people held there on ICE detainers.\r\n13. The secrecy with which ICE and CoreCivic carried out the reopening of the facility has left immigrants and their advocates and attorneys unable to effectively ensure access to counsel and their loved ones. For instance, during a recent California City Planning Commission meeting on September 2, a young child named Monica called in to beg for information about her father's whereabouts. A mother, speaking through an interpreter, related how her son's transfer to the Cal City facility substantially interfered with her ability to assist him in preparing his defense before immigration court. \r\n14. CoreCivic has an exceptionally dangerous, deadly, and abusive track record in its performance of ICE detention services under contracts with ICE. Since ICE began publishing data on deaths in custody, CoreCivic-run facilities have seen more deaths, more findings of preventable death, and more repeat findings of violations, than other contractors. CoreCivic-run facilities top the list of deadliest detention sites in the ICE system, despite having no greater population than comparable facilities operated by the company's competitors. \r\n15. CoreCivic is subject to a nationwide, certified, forced labor class action in the Southern District of California that survived Supreme Court review and is proceeding toward summary judgment. It is unlawful for ICE to enter into contracts with firms that engage in forced labor.\r\n16. There has been exceptional and widespread media interest in the reopening of the Cal City prison, and, based on the violations of law, standards, and policy listed above, there exists significant doubt as to the legality of the government's actions in awarding this contract under current circumstances.

This request does not dispute that point. Instead, it seeks to determine whether COOG has adopted any policy\u2014formal or informal\u2014concerning whether staff may transmit neutral, fact-only complaints or notices when they encounter such conduct in FOIL appeals and determinations that agencies are required by law to forward to COOG (\u00a7 89(4)(a)).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to ensure transparency: either to confirm that no such policy exists (meaning COOG has discretion but chooses not to act), or to identify any written guidance that explains why complaint-forwarding is prohibited. In either case, the public has an interest in understanding how systemic FOIL violations are handled when they rise to the level of potential criminal conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords sought (Jan. 1, 2020\u2013present):\r\n\r\nA. Any written policy, SOP, memo, training slide, or email guidance adopted or used by COOG that addresses whether COOG staff may (or may not) transmit complaints, notices, or factual summaries to\r\n\r\n(i) the State Inspector General\r\n(ii) county district attorneys\r\n(iii) the Office of the State Comptroller Investigations\r\n or (iv) the Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau\r\n\r\nconcerning potential willful concealment or destruction of FOIL\u2011responsive records.\r\n\r\nB. Any records reflecting instances in which COOG transmitted (or declined to transmit) such complaints/notices to any of the authorities in A.\r\n\r\nC. Any legal analysis produced for or held by COOG that interprets FOIL \u00a7\u00a7 89(1)(b), 89(2)(a), 89(4)(a) and/or Penal Law \u00a7 240.65 in relation to COOG\u2019s ability to forward factual materials to enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
