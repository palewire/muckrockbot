Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations, and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nJanet Jo Przewlocki\r\nJanet Jo Johnson\r\nJanet Jo Westermeyer\r\n\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: 083-52-1910. Date of birth is 08/08/1964. Place of birth is Des Moines, IA\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced in as much as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJanet Jo Przewlocki\r\n/\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization.\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\u200b\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJanet Jo Przewlocki\r\n/\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Communications and Correspondence\r\nAll documents, records, communications, correspondence, emails, memoranda, letters, text messages, instant messages, and electronic communications of any kind between any IDFPR employee, contractor, or agent and any representative, employee, or agent of the Illinois Professionals Health Program (IPHP) from January 1, 2019 to the date of this request.\r\n2. Agreements and Contracts\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, service agreements, referral agreements, formal arrangements, informal arrangements, and documents establishing any relationship between IDFPR and IPHP from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n3. IPHP-Related Documentation\r\nAll documents, records, files, reports, studies, evaluations, assessments, policies, procedures, guidelines, protocols, and materials of any kind that contain any reference to, mention of, or discussion of the Illinois Professionals Health Program, IPHP, physician health programs, physician monitoring programs, or impaired physician programs from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n4. Meeting Records\r\nAll meeting minutes, agendas, notes, recordings, transcripts, and records from any meeting, conference call, or discussion where IPHP, physician health programs, physician monitoring, or impaired physicians were discussed from January 1, 2019 to present.\r\n5. Digital Communications Search\r\nAll electronic records, regardless of format or storage location, containing any of the following terms in the subject line, title, filename, or content:\r\n\r\n\"Illinois Professionals Health Program\"\r\n\"IPHP\"\r\n\"physician health\"\r\n\"physician monitoring\"\r\n\"impaired physician\"\r\n\"substance abuse monitoring\"\r\n\"behavioral health monitoring\"\r\n\r\nFORMAT AND SCOPE CLARIFICATIONS\r\nFormat: I request all responsive records in their native electronic format. For emails, please include all metadata, attachments, and embedded images.\r\nTime Period: January 1, 2019 through the date of processing this request.\r\nFee Agreement: I agree to pay all reasonable copying and processing fees. Given that government records are increasingly maintained in digital format, I expect processing costs to be minimal as no physical copying should be required.\r\nBurden Mitigation: To minimize any claimed administrative burden:\r\n\r\nI do not require redaction of exempt information; you may produce records with exempt portions clearly marked\r\nI do not require organization or categorization of responsive records\r\nI accept production on a rolling basis as records are located\r\nElectronic delivery is preferred to minimize processing time and costs\r\n\r\nLEGAL NOTES\r\nClarification on Request Nature: This request seeks existing records and documents only, regardless of their internal titles, filing designations, or naming conventions. I am not requesting answers to questions or asking IDFPR to provide explanations, analyses, or opinions. Per Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28 (1989), I am requesting inspection and copying of existing public records, not interrogatory-style responses. The records sought are whatever documents exist in your possession relating to the specified topics, regardless of what they may be titled or how they are categorized in your filing systems.\r\nNo Record Creation Required: This request seeks existing records only and does not ask IDFPR to create, compile, or analyze any information. The request uses standard FOIA terminology and seeks clearly identifiable categories of records that any regulatory agency would reasonably maintain regarding entities it oversees or works with.\r\nThe requested records relate to matters of significant public interest regarding physician oversight and patient safety. Transparency in regulatory relationships serves the public interest in understanding how physician monitoring is conducted in Illinois.\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TIMELINE\r\nPlease respond within the statutory timeframe. If you need additional time to locate responsive records, please provide a written estimate of when records will be available and the basis for any delay.\r\nIf you determine that any requested records are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed explanation citing the specific statutory exemption and explain why the exemption applies to each withheld record.\r\nIf you claim no responsive records exist, please provide a written explanation of the search methodology used and the systems/locations searched.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivery Preference: Electronic delivery preferred\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nSincerely,\r\nVig Sinclair\r\nMedical Researcher\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act. In your request dated May 25, 2025 you sought records related to ZN86097 to include the following: \r\n\r\n\"The incident report and any supplements, such as Forensic photography taken in relation to shooting incident and captured CCTV security footage taken on the day of the incident at the Westroads Mall located in Omaha, Nebraska on the date of 12/05/07\" \r\n\r\nThis is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712, et seq. \r\nThe Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute does not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. \r\n\r\nAs defined in Neb. Rev Stat 84-712.05(5), supplemental reports, photographs, and security footage are considered records developed by law enforcement agencies charged with duties of investigation, and as such is not considered public record. Therefore, your request for these items is denied. \r\nPlease visit the following link https://police.cityofomaha.org/request-a-police-report to request the public reports or call 402-444-5818. There is a $5 fee for each public report number. Reference ZN86097. \r\nSection 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is responsible for denying a portion of your request. \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in my response to this request. If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.5259.",

Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations, you must describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. Your FOIA request has been closed as insufficient because you did not include a clear and detailed description of the records being requested. Please be advised that the FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries or create records in response to a FOIA request, but rather is limited to requiring agencies to provide access to reasonably described, nonexempt records. As you have failed to reasonably describe the records you are seeking, your request is not a perfected request, and we are unable to initiate a search for responsive records. \r\n\r\nPlease note that requesting records pertaining to contracts requires the specific contract number. In addition, requesting records pertaining to email communications require the email custodians, as well as keywords, in addition to the timeframe provided. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. Please resubmit your FOIA request, along with the required information, by logging into your existing SecureRelease account. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",
