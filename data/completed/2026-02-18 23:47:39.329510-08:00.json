The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requestor,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed your request for \"any and all documents related to the murder of Dr. Haing Samnang Ngor.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Sections 7923.600-7923.625 of the California Government Code, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes, are exempt from disclosure. Should any records be located, 9-1-1 telephone calls, recordings, transcripts, witness statements, logs, crime scene photographs, and video evidence are either investigatory records themselves or properly part of an investigative file and therefore exempt from disclosure. Therefore, we are denying your request. Records may be produced in response to a subpoena or court order with pending litigation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, simply respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n\r\nI am appealing your decision to reject my FOIA request for Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) files related to the murder of Dr. Haing S. Ngor, on February 25, 1996.\r\n\r\nThe previous rejection of my FOIA request cites the California Government Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, the LAPD has already made this material available to other media organizations, and therefore has no basis to deny them to my production of the investigatory podcast, \u201cWho Killed Haing Ngor?\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am repeating my request for the following material, marked by *** below.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Price of Duty,\u201d Season One; Episode 3, the LAPD has participated in production, or shared evidence, in the following ways: \r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary revolves around an extended interview conducted with the full cooperation of Detective Sergeant John Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department.\r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary was conducted with the full cooperation of with Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum.\r\n\r\n-\tThis documentary features a prominent interview with Detective Ed Yee, and a conversation between him and Detective Sergeant Garcia\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned conversations with Detective Sergeant Garcia and Detective Ed Yee\u2019s and their revelation of and discussions about relevant content of the investigation could not have taken place without the consent of the LAPD.  \r\n\r\nTo Wit: \r\n\r\nAUDIO\r\nDetective Sergeant Garcia and Deputy District Attorney Hum reference the contents of recordings of \u201cprior statements\u201d made by witnesses to police before the trial. \r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of the tape-recordings of \u201cprior statements,\u201d made by police, referenced by Hum and Garcia. \r\n\r\nThe LAPD shared with documentary-makers crime scene photos, including images from inside of the victim's vehicle; images of spent shell casings; pages from the Coroner's report; and diagrams from the crime scene.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of crime scene photos, including but not limited to those shared with documentary-makers, in preparation for their production. (This request includes those photographs shown to the producers of the documentary for selection of inclusion in their production, not limited to only those televised.) \r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance in which investigative file contents were shared with the media. \r\n\r\nThese photos were also shared with media in \u201cThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor,\u201d a documentary produced in 2015 by Arthur Dong, of Deep Focus Productions, Inc.\r\n\r\nDuring this documentary, crime scene photographs were shared with the production team, \r\nincluding those depicting Ngor\u2019s body at rest; and exteriors and interiors of Ngor\u2019s apartment, and other photographs depicting evidence and police activities. \r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of all investigative file documents and photographs provided to producers for review for inclusion in their documentary.\r\n\r\nI have reached out both production companies with regards to what documents and photographs they were provided access to in the making of their films. However, I have yet to hear back. \r\n \r\nINTERVIEW GRANTED TO MEDIA\r\nIn 2024, Detective Ed Yee gave an on the record interview to Los Angeles-based production company, Western Sound, for their \u201cStrangeland \u2013 Killing Fields of LA\u201d podcast on the Ngor murder. \r\n\r\nAmong other investigative revelations Detective Ed Yee discussed, he also said, \"I had friends that lived right next door to Haing Ngor or lived across the street from Haing Ngor\" at the time of Ngor's murder. \r\n\r\nThis information was corroborated to me by a third party, known to me.\r\n\r\n*** Therefore, I request all notes and reports related to Detective Ed Yee\u2019s interviewing of those people and whether they identified any of the three defendants as possible suspects; and any written disclosures by Yee of his relationship with any of the potential witnesses.\r\n\r\n*** Based on Detective Yee\u2019s candid revelation of his participation in this investigation during a podcast interview, I would like access to all of Detective Yee\u2019s notes and reports. \r\n\r\nGiven the above, the precedent has been set for sharing this material with media, and there is no reason to deny my request.\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that these separate productions have intellectual property rights, and represent my competition, I cannot use any other media organization\u2019s material in my production.\r\nTherefore, I demand at least equal access to the same documents, files, recordings and reports that they had, up to and including interviews with Detective John Garcia, Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum, and Detective Ed Yee. \r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation. I think we would all rather avoid a First Amendment case on this matter, but I am open to pursuing every option legally available to me.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan",

Ngor, on February 25, 1996.\r\n\r\nThe previous rejection of my FOIA request cites the California Government Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, the LAPD has already made this material available to other media organizations, and therefore has no basis to deny them to my production of the investigatory podcast, \u201cWho Killed Haing Ngor?\u201d\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am repeating my request for the following material, marked by *** below.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Price of Duty,\u201d Season One; Episode 3, the LAPD has participated in production, or shared evidence, in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- This documentary revolves around an extended interview conducted with the full cooperation of Detective Sergeant John Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department.\r\n\r\n- This documentary was conducted with the full cooperation of with Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum.\r\n\r\n- This documentary features a prominent interview with Detective Ed Yee, and a conversation between him and Detective Sergeant Garcia\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned conversations with Detective Sergeant Garcia and Detective Ed Yee\u2019s and their revelation of and discussions about relevant content of the investigation could not have taken place without the consent of the LAPD.\r\n\r\nTo Wit:\r\n\r\nAUDIO\r\nDetective Sergeant Garcia and Deputy District Attorney Hum reference the contents of recordings of \u201cprior statements\u201d made by witnesses to police before the trial.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of the tape-recordings of \u201cprior statements,\u201d made by police, referenced by Hum and Garcia.\r\n\r\nThe LAPD shared with documentary-makers crime scene photos, including images from inside of the victim's vehicle; images of spent shell casings; pages from the Coroner's report; and diagrams from the crime scene.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of crime scene photos, including but not limited to those shared with documentary-makers, in preparation for their production. (This request includes those photographs shown to the producers of the documentary for selection of inclusion in their production, not limited to only those televised.)\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance in which investigative file contents were shared with the media.\r\n\r\nThese photos were also shared with media in \u201cThe Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor,\u201d a documentary produced in 2015 by Arthur Dong, of Deep Focus Productions, Inc.\r\n\r\nDuring this documentary, crime scene photographs were shared with the production team,\r\nincluding those depicting Ngor\u2019s body at rest; and exteriors and interiors of Ngor\u2019s apartment, and other photographs depicting evidence and police activities.\r\n\r\n*** I hereby request copies of all investigative file documents and photographs provided to producers for review for inclusion in their documentary.\r\n\r\nI have reached out both production companies with regards to what documents and photographs they were provided access to in the making of their films. However, I have yet to hear back.\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW GRANTED TO MEDIA\r\nIn 2024, Detective Ed Yee gave an on the record interview to Los Angeles-based production company, Western Sound, for their \u201cStrangeland \u2013 Killing Fields of LA\u201d podcast on the Ngor murder.\r\n\r\nAmong other investigative revelations Detective Ed Yee discussed, he also said, \"I had friends that lived right next door to Haing Ngor or lived across the street from Haing Ngor\" at the time of Ngor's murder.\r\n\r\nThis information was corroborated to me by a third party, known to me.\r\n\r\n*** Therefore, I request all notes and reports related to Detective Ed Yee\u2019s interviewing of those people and whether they identified any of the three defendants as possible suspects; and any written disclosures by Yee of his relationship with any of the potential witnesses.\r\n\r\n*** Based on Detective Yee\u2019s candid revelation of his participation in this investigation during a podcast interview, I would like access to all of Detective Yee\u2019s notes and reports.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, the precedent has been set for sharing this material with media, and there is no reason to deny my request.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that these separate productions have intellectual property rights, and represent my competition, I cannot use any other media organization\u2019s material in my production.\r\nTherefore, I demand at least equal access to the same documents, files, recordings and reports that they had, up to and including interviews with Detective John Garcia, Deputy District Attorney Craig Hum, and Detective Ed Yee.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation. I think we would all rather avoid a First Amendment case on this matter, but I am open to pursuing every option legally available to me.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMary Patricia Nunan\r\n\r\n",

I apologize for not having been able to locate these records on your website myself initially. \r\n\r\nBut I'm just following up now because unfortunately I still cannot locate the CVR data on your webpage. Really sorry about this - I've spent a lot of time at the link you provided looking for CVR data of any kind but have had no luck. I am attaching a screenshot of what the page returns when I search for just the 2024 General election.  In the screenshot you can see that under \"Data Exports\" only the precinct level returns are available to download across all formats (pdf, csv, html). These data provide just the vote totals by office and precinct. I don't see anything about CVR records anywhere, including under the advanced search. I have also attached the CSV file that is output when I click \"Precinct Results\" just for your reference in case it is helpful.\r\n\r\nMy sincerest apologies for the hassle with this. I am trying my hardest to locate the records myself on your website but I have just been unable to find what you describe in this email. I would be extremely remiss to create additional work for you but I am at a loss. I hope you understand, and thank you very much again for your time and patience. \r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\nAleksandra Conevska ",

Your request was received in this office January 28, 2026, and assigned control number 2026-FSA-02533-F. Please use this control number for all future communications regarding this request.\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are unable to begin processing your request at this time because we cannot determine precisely which records you are seeking.  In your request form, you state that you are requesting\r\n\u200b\r\n\"the 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 applications to receive subsidies under the programs: Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), Milk Loss Program (MLP), Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) for the following producers: * Varel Dairy; Bartelso, Illinois. * Thole AG; Aviston, Illinois. * JB Timmermann Farms; Breese, Illinois.* Four Beck Dairy; Bartleso, Illinois. * C D & R Farms, Inc.; Breese, Illinois.* Dall Dairy; Aviston, Illinois * Glen Von Bokel Farms; Carlyle, Illinois * Aaron Hilmes; Carlyle, Illinois * Corey Hilmes; Breese, Illinois * Arentsen Farms; Albers, Illinois\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\nHowever, we need to confirm whether you have written consent from the producer(s)/entity(ies) listed above to receive unredacted copies of their DMC, MLP and DIPP applications?  If yes, please provide a copy of the consent by replying to this email.  If not, are you willing to receive redacted versions of these documents instead?\r\n\r\nWe cannot proceed further with your request until we receive additional written clarification from you.  Please note that if we do not hear from you within 20 business days from the date of this email, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and we will administratively close your request.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you requested a fee waiver. You were placed in the \u201cMedia Use\u201d requester category, as such all fees are waived.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you also requested expedited processing of your request. According to USDA regulations at Title 7, CFR 1.9(b), it is the policy of FSA to grant a request for expedited processing whenever the requester demonstrates that the request involves:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information\r\n\r\nYou state that you are requesting expedited processing of your request, because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity, however, your letter did not provide an adequate justification to support your argument.  Therefore, we are processing your request on a \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d basis in the complex track.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the determination to deny your request for expedited processing is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator.  The Appeals and Litigation Staff must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.  You may submit your appeal electronically to FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov<mailto:FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov> or by mail.

        "communication": "Ms. Hundsdorfer,\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated January 26, 2026, which was received in this office on January 28, 2026, and assigned control number 2026-FSA-02533-F.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request, we located the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms, Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes and Corey Hilmes, comprising of 80 pages.  With respect to these pages, we are releasing 8 pages in full,  72 pages redacted in part, and zero (0) pages withheld in full, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) and (b)(6) of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nElectronic copies have been sent as attachments to this email.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DMC, Milk Loss Program (MLP), and Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) documents for Glen Von Bokel Farms and Arentsen Farms, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for MLP documents for Varel Dairy,  Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms, Inc, Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DIPP documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms,  Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for 2020 DMC documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nExemption 3 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3): protects information included in FSA's records specifically exempted from disclosure by another Federal Statute.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 3, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nIn this instance Section 1619(b) of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (7 USC \u00a7 8791), prohibits disclosing the information requested.\r\n\r\nThe records you have requested include information that FSA has obtained from agricultural producers or landowners that concerns their farming or agricultural operation, including production and marketing of agricultural commodities and livestock, farming practices, conservation practices or the land itself.  The type of information withheld includes producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address. This information is required to be provided to FSA for the agricultural producers and/or landowners shown on these records to participate in FSA's farm programs.\r\n\r\nExemption 6 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6): Exemption 6 protects personal information affecting an individual's privacy.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 6, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, exemption 6 protects personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The courts have held that the phrase \"similar files\" involves all information that applies to a particular person. When disclosure of information about particular individuals is requested, the courts have decided that it is necessary for us to determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly \"unwarranted\" invasion of the individuals' privacy. To make this determination, we are required to perform a \"balancing test.\" This means that we must weigh the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to disclosure. In this instance, we have determined that the disclosure of this information would shed little or no light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties and that, on balance; the public interest to be served by its disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals in question, in withholding it. The records withheld under this exemption are producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address.\r\n\r\nIf you believe our decision to withhold this information is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator. The Appeals and Litigation Division must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.  You may submit your appeal electronically to FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov<mailto:FSAFOIAappeal@wdc.usda.gov>  or by mail.

The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

As a result, we\r\nwill require several additional weeks to prepare a complete cost estimate.\r\nWhile our standard practice is to provide a quote within five business days,\r\nthe scope of this request far exceeds typical volume. We are committed to\r\nfulfilling your request and ensuring timely access to contextual records such\r\nas video and photographs; however, providing every single responsive file would\r\nrequire extensive redaction work estimated at over $3,000 and several months of\r\nprocessing. To expedite access, please let us know if you are agreeable to\r\nlimiting the scope of this request to files that will still provide you with\r\nkey details, photos, and video. \r\nIf you agree, we will provide you with your cost by January\r\n15th, 2025. Once the deposit is received, we do anticipate it will take\r\napproximately 3\u20134 months to complete redactions, as we would need to work this\r\ncase into our regular caseload due to the amount of responsive items.

All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The five most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee concerning immigration matters. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest.

Including final ticket sales and event costs, if available.\r\nCSU has conducted a reasonable search for these records under California Government Code \u00a77922.535 and has determined that your request, either in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records.  CSU will make available to you any that are public.\r\n\r\nRecords subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:  Deliberative Process. Records that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available January 24, 2026.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.  We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process. The decision that records are exempt and will not be disclosed was made by the Records Access Officer at CSULB, Jamarr Johnson.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

CSU will make available to you any that are public.  Records subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:\r\n\r\nRecords that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available by July 25, 2025.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.\u202f We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

The records will be emailed to the email address used to submit the request.\r\n\r\nNote: If a check is returned for non-payment, an NSF fee of $50.00 will be charged each time that same item is presented for payment when an account lacks sufficient available funds, and it is returned unpaid as a result. Additionally,  future checks will not be accepted for payment, only cash or money order.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\nGrace Ramirez, FOIA Specialist\r\nController\u2019s Office\r\nEaton County Courthouse\r\n1045 Independence Blvd.\r\nCharlotte, MI 48813\r\nPhone: 517.543.2287\r\nFax: 517.543.3331\r\n[A close up of a logo  Description automatically generated]",
