Will that really happen?\u201d Bondi responded: \u201cIt is sitting on my desk right now to review. That has been a directive by President Trump. I am reviewing that.\u201d  You can see the full interview here: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bondi-says-epstein-client-list-sitting-my-desk-right-now-reviewing-jfk-mlk-files\r\n\r\nI seek all of the Epstein-related records that Bondi was referring to during this interview appearance, including the document or documents she was referring to when she stated \"It is sitting on my desk right now to review.\" This request also seeks the \"list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients\" that Bondi was asked about by the Fox News reporter and confirmed having in her possession during the interview appearance.\r\n\r\nI do not seek a copy of the publicly available list of Epstein's associates that was unsealed by a judge in 2024 in a civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, and which is described in this CBS News article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-list-associates-unsealed-judge-rules/\r\n\r\nI am a reporter for The Nation magazine and other outlets. I seek a fee waiver, but if that waiver is denied I am willing to pay up to $25 for these records.\r\n\r\nI seek expedited processing for this request. The information I seek could shed light on a matter of urgent and compelling public interest -- namely, the potential involvement of federal government personnel in the alleged sex trafficking operation organized by the late Jeffrey Epstein. This information is at the center of public discourse at this moment, and the Epstein case is a matter that involves the White House, Congress and numerous judicial bodies. It is imperative that the public obtain information on this matter in a timely matter, particularly given the corrosive effects the Epstein case has had on trust in government. For the reasons above, I ask that my request be given expedited processing because there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity, and I am a person primarily engaged in disseminating information. I intend to use the requested records to inform the public about actual government activity. I certify the foregoing to be true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Mr Tobias,\r\n\r\nPlease permit me to introduce myself.   I am general counsel to the North Department of Agriculture (NDDA).  Your below email open public records request has been forwarded to me.\r\n\r\nI reviewed your below open public records request requesting NDDA records.  I am responding back to you on behalf of NDDA.\r\n\r\nIn your attached open public records request, you requested:\r\n\r\nAll investigative reports, memos, case files, letters or other records in the possession of the North Dakota Department of Agriculture concerning the Arthur Companies' 2017 spill of rinsate, which contaminated the farm field of Donald Garnas in or around Page, North Dakota.  This request includes any records in the possession of pesticide enforcer Tyler Kralicek.\r\n\r\nThese pesticide records you request, if they exist, are confidential under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 4.1-33-21(5)(a).  These requested records, if they exist, would pertain to pesticide application, sales, purchases, and repackaging.\r\n\r\nN.D.C.C. \u00a7 4.1-33-21(5)(a) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \"At any reasonable time, the commissioner may access records pertaining to the pesticide application, sales, purchases, and repackaging by any person.  The commissioner may copy or make copies of the records for the purpose of this chapter.  These records are confidential.  ...  Any record the commissioner uses as an exhibit in an enforcement action is no longer a confidential record.\"\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with N.D.C.C. \u00a7 4.1-33-21(5)(a) immediately above, NDDA records related to violation investigations (or any other records that pertain to pesticide application, sales, purchases, and repackaging) are confidential unless:  (1) the records have been used as an exhibit in an enforcement action; or, (2) as confidential records, the records are released under a court order in accordance with N.D.C.C. \u00a7 44-04-18.11.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the above-mentioned matter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   None of these requested records have been used as an exhibit in an enforcement action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   No party to any applicable litigation has requested a court to order the confidential records disclosed.  If such confidential records are directed to be disclosed pursuant to a court order, in conjunction with such a court order, NDDA commonly seeks a protective order for the disclosed confidential records (to only disclose the records to the parties of the case, and to prevent further disclosure).  In this regard, in cases involving private civil litigation in which the NDDA is not a party, a reasonable accommodation might be worked in which NDDA objects to the third-party subpoena served by a party to the litigation, and a judge may then order the release of the otherwise confidential documents to all parties to that ligation under appropriate protective handling instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, for your further reference, in accordance with N.D.C.C. \u00a7 4.1-33-21.5(b):\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \"If an individual alleges exposure to pesticides and if the individual's medical provider requests that the commissioner reveal the name of the pesticide, the commissioner may reveal the name of the pesticide to the individual making the request, together with the registration number assigned by the United States environmental protection agency.  The commissioner may require a request under this section be made in writing.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in view of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 4.1-33-21.5(b) immediately above:  if (1) human pesticide exposure is at issue; (2) you allege an individual's alleged exposure to pesticides; and, (3) that individual's medical provider requests the name of the pesticide in writing, the agriculture commissioner will then review the written request and make a determination as to whether the name of the pesticide and its registration number may be released.\r\n\r\nI am unaware of any pending or active litigation in relation to this matter.  If litigation has been commenced regarding this matter, please provide me a copy of the filed complaint\r\n\r\nAny charges associated with this email response to the below email open records request, dated August 5, 2025, are waived.\r\n\r\nPlease direct any additional questions or concerns in relation to these above matters to me at (701) 328-1496 or bialkej@nd.gov<mailto:%20bialkej@nd.gov>.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDutch Bialke\r\n\r\nJ.P. \"Dutch\" Bialke\r\nGeneral Counsel/Senior Policy Advisor\r\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General\r\nND Department of Agriculture\r\n600 E.

        "communication": "Hello Mr. Bialke,\r\n\r\nThank you for the note. I appreciate your quick response. Based on the reporting from the Bismarck Tribune, the Agricultural Department brought an enforcement action against Arthur Companies for the rinsate spill in question. Is it your contention that none of the records related to this enforcement action can can be disclosed to the public? Would none of the records qualify as exhibits related to an enforcement action?  I am also curious about the specific language of the disclosure exemption. My understanding of the situation is that the contamination in question did not concern \"application, sales, purchases, and repackaging\" of pesticides, but rather the \"disposal\" of pesticides, which would indicate to me that these records do not fall under the provision you cited. Please clarify if possible and thank you.\r\n\r\nWe are very eager to make these records public. If the Department will not release these records, what are next steps in terms of appealing the Department's decision?\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias \r\n2487630088\r\njtoby87@gmail.com ",

According to documents released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production in 2022. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; photographs; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
