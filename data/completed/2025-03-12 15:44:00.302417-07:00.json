        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI received your request for \"unedited videos\" from the Nicolae Miu case. This is NOT something I could release to you legally as all videos WILL be edited and redacted. There were many juveniles in this case and juveniles are a protected class, as well as victims who are protected under Marsy's Law. Below is the letter that explains all redactions made to all videos relating to the Nicolae Miu case. The cost to receive this request is just shy of $20 and it is far too large to send electronically. Please let me know if you are still interested in receiving the case file that was sent out to all requesters; media and otherwise, and I will send a flash drive and invoice around March. Thank you,\r\n\r\nDear Records Requester:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your request for records regarding St. Croix County Sheriff's Office case SO2022006400. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office does have records that meet your request. The Spanish language interviews are included in these records.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stats \u00a7\u00a7938.396(1)(c)2 law enforcement records involving a juvenile may be released to another party only with the written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, or the juvenile themselves, if the juvenile is 14 years or older. I did not receive a single written consent form with any of your requests for records; therefore, all videos, photos, and reports mentioning or showing juveniles under the age of eighteen have been redacted or removed from the case files prior to release. The only exception I have knowingly made is that I have kept the deceased victim, Isaac Schuman's name only intact throughout. In applying the balancing act, disclosure of this already publicly named victim outweighs the interest in non-disclosure of this information. Pursuant to Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, \u00b626, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. The public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime-especially children affected by very sensitive crimes-weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\r\n\r\nWell-established public policy recognizes the privacy rights of a deceased person's surviving loved ones. Cf. National Archives and Records Admin. V. Favish, 540 U.S. 157, 168, 171-72 (2004). In preparing these records for release, the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test was applied, and the public interest in treating loved ones of the deceased individual with respect for their privacy and dignity outweighed any public interest in disclosure of any graphic images in photographs and videos of Isaac Schuman; therefore any images of Isaac and his family have been removed or redacted prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pertaining to the release of law enforcement records, the harm to the public interest caused by the release of identities of victims of crimes overrides the public interest in release. Based on Marsy's Law, there is a strong public policy favoring nondisclosure of some of the requested records for the protection of the victims detailed within the reports. The policy implications as set forth in Article I, Section 9m of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 950.01 is that all victims of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, sensitivity, and privacy. \u00a7 950.04(1v)(dr) states victims of all crimes have the following rights: (dr) to not have his or her personal identifiers, as defined in s. 85.103 (1) used or disclosed by a public official, employee, or agency for a purpose that is unrelated to the official responsibilities of the official, employee, or agency. In addition, there is a strong public interest favoring nondisclosure which outweighs the public interest in disclosure based on the potential for further victimization of the innocent victims. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)1 - 1. It shall be the public policy of this state to maintain the privacy of a record subject who is a victim of a sensitive or violent crime and access to data from a body camera used by a law enforcement officer that records such a record subject shall be provided only if the public interest in allowing access is so great as to outweigh that public policy. Our department has received no signed consent forms allowing release of these victims' private information. Records will not be released that contain personal information regarding several stabbing victims from this case.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims and respect their personal information, victim names and images have been redacted.\r\n\r\nIn performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of persons collaterally mentioned in a law enforcement report outweighs any legitimate public interest in information about the conduct of governmental affairs. Furthermore, I determined that the public interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals, and in facilitating cooperation with law enforcement in sensitive investigations, also outweigh any public interest in disclosure of this described information. Any notebooks, reports, computer screens, audio, or video that may contain this information may be pixelated, muted, beeped out, blacked out, blurred, redacted, or removed. Additionally, the following statutes were applied in reviewing and consideration of releasing these records:\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Dates of birth, phone numbers, driver's license number, passport numbers, social security numbers and addresses for which we have not received a waiver to release have been redacted to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In performing the public records balancing test, pursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(a), I concluded that the public policy in favor of protecting the confidentiality of individual's identifiable information and preventing its misuse upon any subsequent disclosure, as well as the public polices outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7\u00a7 801.19, 801.20 and 801.21, outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the dates of birth, driver's license/state ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses or social security numbers of individual persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   \"Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 146.82, the St. Croix County's Sheriff's Office is not disclosing records that contain protected health information (PHI).\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2 governs people with a reasonable expectation of privacy pictured in law enforcement body camera recordings so some people's images, especially within the hospital, have been protected. Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a751.30 and 19.35, medical information has been redacted or omitted. Medical records may be omitted from release as outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7146.82.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.30(4)(a), records related to mental health welfare checks are confidential and cannot be released except to the subject of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Cellphone extraction records are being withheld. After conducting the balancing test, I have determined that there is a strong public interest against disclosure that outweighs the interest in disclosure in order to protect the privacy of individuals who may be included in the cellphone extraction records that are unrelated to the case/incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 534, information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wisconsin Department of Justice that is entered into the Crime Information Bureau is not being disclosed. Specifically, 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1) indicates that information from national crime information databases consisting of identification records, criminal history records, protection orders, and wanted person records may be disseminated to civil or criminal courts for use in domestic violence or stalking cases. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit access to such records for any other purpose. Therefore, any information obtained from the national crime information database is redacted and not being disclosed, pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a719.36(13), personal and business financial account information is considered personal and confidential and has been redacted. Any and all invoices and bank related reports have been removed from your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7165.79, Crime Lab analysis of evidence obtained from law enforcement officers are not subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Personal cell telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which are economically valuable individually identifiable information, were redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In applying the balancing test, DOJ determined the public interest in protecting this economically valuable individually identifiable information from misappropriation or misuse outweighs any public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2, the public's interest in disclosure of other jail inmates is not outweighed by the public interest in non-disclosure. Jail inmates who are not the subject of the record have an expectation of privacy in the jail.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any video which has been redacted to the point there is nothing of value left to release has been omitted from this release.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records laws exist to ensure an open and transparent government. The personal communication of an inmate does not affect government business operations unless it involves a potential safety or security issue as identified in DOC 309.39. Although the inmate is informed of the recordings  of the calls, he or she would likely to be reluctant to communicate if these records were disclosed as a public record. This impact on communication if treated as a releasable public record would undermine the rehabilitative aspect of maintaining communication between the inmate and the inmate's family, friends, government officials, courts and people concerned with the welfare of the inmate. Open communication fosters reintegration into the community and the maintenance of family ties. It motivates the inmate and contributes to the morale and security of the inmate and staff. For these reasons the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office has determined that any of Nicolae Miu's phone calls, video logs, visitation reports, or activities from within our jail are not being released with your request for records.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be more information about law enforcement records pursuant to this request, but the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is not the legal custodian of those records.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DB5A94.6CA98430]\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\n\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\n\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov<mailto:Tammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

We have received more than 25 previous requests for this case file. I am afraid I do not understand the reference numbers you have provided. Where did these come from? We do not use those types of numbers or labeling to mark any of our videos. Please feel free to call me if you would like to explain further what it is you are looking for. Again, there were several juveniles and victims in the Nicolae Miu case, so the videos are very heavily redacted.\r\n\r\nWe are very limited to how much cloud storage we are allotted, and I am a one-woman records department who has handled more than 2,500 requests for records so far this year. We have determined that agency requests must take precedence for what we can send electronically as we work with several other law enforcement agencies in order to handle important cases. Any costs are based on our actual cost of producing the records requested so the cost is only for the cost of the flash drive and the postage.\r\n\r\nYour request is in my queue; however, there are almost thirty requests received prior and request for videos are handled in the order in which they are received.

If so, I have released the same release to every single requester after having it approved by my Captain and our Corporation Counsel. I have no additional videos to provide towards this request. If you are referring to a different case, please let me know and I can look into this further. Many, many people have released videos from the Nicolae Miu case. Clerk of Courts and other police departments may have additional videos to offer, but everything our department is releasing has been released.  Some videos names changed after redactions so I am unable to determine which officer's footage they came from. But I have NO other information to provide or release relating to the Nicolae Miu case.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the thousand oaks police Department\u2019s use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the Department\u2019s use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the department\u2019s aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the department used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the Department\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

I am currently a student journalist at Emerson College and have reported about the South River encampment in the past. As these records pertain to the transparency of our public officials in the treatment of homeless community members on public grounds, I would request the fees for this request be waived on the grounds of clear public interest as is suggested by the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. As section 24-31(g)(vii) lays out how fees should not be charged in regards to processing claims in filing appeals to recover property pursuant to the \"City Storage Program Policy,\" I would ask that this standard be extended to this request as it is not made in the commercial interest but in the interest of transparency regarding the same policy. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and will not be made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Nu\u00f1ez",

Burke who oversees the CIU (Community Impact Unit):\r\n\r\nAll individuals were aware that the site was being closed and had ample time to remove any property that they wished.  Anyone who wanted to have the PD store property would have been able to do so.  Not one individual requested we store their personal property.  This was not unexpected as most individuals, housed or unhoused, do not want to turn over their possessions to the police.  However, we were on site to do so on the date of the closure.  Again, no one wanted to give officers property.\r\n\r\nThe remaining items (tents, furniture, misc. Items, etc.) were so highly contaminated by human waste and hypodermic needles that it would not be permissible to store at the station safely.\r\n\r\nOfficers also asked individuals if they had everything they wanted to retrieve.\r\n\r\nNo one has come forward to tell us that any property that was wanted was disposed of.\r\n\r\nAlso lastly, there is mention of the property in the report.  That would be our documentation.  There would be no separate report.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this office can be of any other assistance, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to challenge any aspect of this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records following the procedure set forth in 950 C.M.R. 32.08, a copy of which is available at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/law-lib/laws-by-source/cmr/<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%252Fcourts%252Fcase-legal-res%252Flaw-lib%252Flaws-by-source%252Fcmr%252F%26data%3deJxljM0KgzAQhJ_G3BJsI0oPOXhpS699gjWuUcmPZGODb99Ij4VhmBk-Rqu26bpBtvJWTxdko9IxZL94mhe0o9DBMaee2KyvvnsfDxMZKTAR0WPV1AQW3TYKj4lFtU7goKz_F7uaU9oq2VfXe1HOWTggEiZ8StVhj4nOAITcogHLI56DhcztMvwS8eHgVFiNJ-ti8S9s8kFM&c=E,1,9wSSFxRFBoCPkfGE9giAhbeiiMiNeJa2thFtN3KO3mXdBru7FvRDbyhMmQdWKzs3wlXwPj0Dh1DNotHM_IJRgAK8YD9z6um0cWRVDQpA&typo=1>\r\n\r\nCode of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR)<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%252Fcourts%252Fcase-legal-res%252Flaw-lib%252Flaws-by-source%252Fcmr%252F%26data%3deJxljM0KgzAQhJ_G3BJsI0oPOXhpS699gjWuUcmPZGODb99Ij4VhmBk-Rqu26bpBtvJWTxdko9IxZL94mhe0o9DBMaee2KyvvnsfDxMZKTAR0WPV1AQW3TYKj4lFtU7goKz_F7uaU9oq2VfXe1HOWTggEiZ8StVhj4nOAITcogHLI56DhcztMvwS8eHgVFiNJ-ti8S9s8kFM&c=E,1,v7NE_uyG8VFLvYWukT6C3dwdLAUrAZeLSCp1xsMsjbx4x_v-kFGKPOPoEbbaQo8Yjj5Ud6_6_EGae0KjmKeH3r_9X0r7qL8C3h3ihjbDz3rOCpLLnw,,&typo=1>\r\n\r\nFind regulations issued by all state agencies by number or by subject.\r\n\r\nwww.mass.gov<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%26data%3deJxlzLEOwiAQgOGngZFUISUON3RR4-oTnHClbXrQAJb07e1u8k_f8DvojbUf3etbN15IenA5tTjHMs20euUSS4YnmeU12PfxCFkWwJCJIgnTFVyJN68iVZlhGZHx1P_FF6ZaN6EHcb2ftdYUYykqpP0HF5osUg%2525%2525&c=E,1,J8BH6Hbh5FcyZ_VbsuXCkaL3NU3YvdsRBxjBl1xgB3R8mTzT6x46q1hERPJgRbJ_p2WiLtGu8VpD4cLl28l0OnacnlFYrS_HYQlwKnjg-fi1Z01xiOMOIptUCKo,&typo=1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Marie Greene\r\n\r\nPrincipal Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport Services - Records Division\r\n\r\nSalem Police Department\r\n\r\n95 Margin St Salem Ma 01970\r\n\r\n978-744-0171 ext 50132\r\n\r\nagreene@salempd.net<mailto:agreene@salempd.net>\r\n\r\nRecords Division Homepage<https://www.salem.com/salem-police-department/contact-us/pages/public-records-requests>\r\nSalem Police Department Homepage<https://www.salem.com/salem-police-department>\r\nA Guide to Massachusetts Public Records Law<https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf>\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Services Window Hours of Operations:\r\n\r\nRecords Inquiry Request Form Click Here<https://www.salemma.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif7986/f/uploads/public_records_request_form_pdf.pdf>\r\n\r\nMondays 9a-3p\r\n\r\nTuesdays 9a-3p\r\n\r\nThursdays 11a-7p\r\n\r\nFridays 9a-12p\r\n\r\n[cid:9cb9cb15-d903-4298-abd1-39cd833de12c]\n",

DCJS received a deposit for an outstanding previous FOIA request from you and/or your organization on March 3, 2025, and processed this request beginning on that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached to this email, you will find an Excel spreadsheet that contains the number of certified officers and/or jailers at each law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth. However, please be aware that contrary to the language used in your FOIA request, Virginia does not license officers; Virginia only certifies officers. In addition, DCJS does not have information on the total employees of each Virginia law enforcement agency, only the certified law enforcement officers reported to DCJS by the individual agencies.  Accordingly, pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3704.B(3) DCJS responds that no such records exist regarding the total employees of each Virginia law enforcement agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you requested, this information has been provided \"in a machine-readable database or spreadsheet format such as Excel...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPayne Tarkenton\r\n\r\nFOIA Officer\r\n\r\nVirginia Department of Criminal Justice Services\r\n\r\n1100 Bank Street, Richmond, VA 23219\r\n\r\nPhone 804-786-3051\r\n\r\nwww.dcjs.virginia.gov<http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor up to date information, subscribe to \"DCJS Updates\": www.dcjs.virginia.gov/subscribe<http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/subscribe>\r\nVisit us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/vadcjs<http://www.facebook.com/vadcjs> and Flickr: www.flickr.com/photos/va_dcjs<http://www.flickr.com/photos/va_dcjs>\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:\r\nThe contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department conducted a query and has identified email communications that are currently under review for any information exempt under various provisions of the CPRA.

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1.

At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in January 2025.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Government Code Sections 7927.700 and 7927.705. Section 7927.700 exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Section 7927.705 exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to provisions of the Penal Code. Penal Code Section 832.7(a) states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code. Therefore, we are denying your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the final release of the Department\u2019s rolling production.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Government Code Sections 7927.700 and 7927.705. Section 7927.700 exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Section 7927.705 exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to provisions of the Penal Code. Penal Code Section 832.7(a) states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code. Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain personnel information are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld or are being provided to you with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities.

Your request stated: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nI am requesting data on crime incidents\u2014those classified by your agency as crimes\u2014rather than calls for service or unfounded incidents. \r\n\u2022 Year(s) Requested: 2010 and 2011 \r\n\u2022 Columns Requested: Incident date, Incident time, Type of crime (e.g., robbery, theft, etc.), Incident ID, and all other available columns that do not require additional processing by the agency or redaction. \r\n\r\nIf the data are stored in a proprietary or custom electronic format not publicly available, I request that it be converted to a format viewable with standard software, such as Microsoft Excel or CSV. Please avoid providing data in PDF or paper printouts. \r\n\r\nThis request is made to support academic research conducted in the public interest and is not for commercial purposes. The data will contribute to a research project assessing the effect of music concerts on crime, aiming to enhance public understanding of how large events influence community safety. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nKristina Block \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-jose-police-department-670%252F2010-and-2011-crime-incidents-request-san-jose-police-department-182457%252F%253Femail%253DVeronica.Morales%252540sanjoseca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAbyJREpeqygXmy-nSKVuqeUHg%3A1tq1Wo%3AvwvnusPSQpCSsLLz70vq4fuU-6pt_CJzfLc0zoKuSzk\" \r\nPlease refer to the attached response from the San Jose Police Department regarding your request. \r\nPlease contact me if you have any questions pertaining to your Public Records Act request in the My Records Center. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJane Nguyen \r\nAnalyst \r\nPolice - Research and Development Unit",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The names of deputies who work in undercover, plain clothes positions that demand anonymity were removed pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000. Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.4th 278, 301 (2007). The anonymity of these deputies is essential to their safety and effectiveness, and warrants exempting their identity and information about their position from disclosure. The public interest served by not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the information.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request to include badge numbers, serial numbers, currently no roster with the information sought in the format you have requested exists. Historical reports do not include badge numbers.  A public agency is not required to generate new substantive content or create inventories of data in response to a records request. Sander v. Superior Court (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651.  Therefore, the Sheriff's Office is providing the rosters with names and stations.\r\n\r\nYour request is now closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErica Duarte, Administrative Analyst\r\n\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\"",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations) \r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.\u00a0 Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations,\u00a0CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\u00a0 Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 Currently, the average time to process a FOIA request related to \"travel/border incidents\" is a minimum of 2-4 months. We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/facial-recognition-technology. Specifically, page 31 of the section 'Facial Recognition Part 1' (https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2024-Apr/Facial Recognition Part 1.pdf) \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2020-041143 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

In order to obtain a copy of a video, you must first initiate a civil action or file a Petition For Release (AOC form CV-270) with the Mecklenburg County Clerk of Court. Once the Petition for Release has been filed with the courthouse, a file-stamped copy of the Petition may be served on CMPD through the Police Attorney's office at: CMPD Police Attorney office 601 E Trade St Charlotte, NC 28202 \r\n  \r\n Disclosure of Recordings (Viewing ONLY) \r\n  \r\n As noted above, N.C.G.S. 132-1.4A also states that certain persons are entitled to disclosures, or viewings, of law enforcement recordings. This does not include getting a copy of the recordings. By statute, those persons are: \r\n  \r\n A person whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A spouse if the spouse whose image or voice is in the recording consents to the disclosure. Notarization of the request form is required by the consenting spouse. \r\n An attorney retained to represent a person whose image or voice is in the recording. Notarization of the request form by the client is required. \r\n A parent of a minor whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A guardian of a minor or adult whose image or voice is in the recording. Guardianship documentation is required. \r\n A personal representative of a deceased person whose image or voice is in the recording. Executorship, Power of Attorney, or other legal documentation required. \r\n A personal representative of an adult person who is incapacitated and unable to provide consent to disclosure. Power of Attorney or other legal documentation required. \r\n  \r\n NOTE: the statute defines a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d as a parent, court-appointed guardian, spouse, or attorney of a person whose image or voice is in the recording. If a person whose image or voice is in the recording is deceased, the term also means the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person; the deceased person's surviving spouse, parent, or adult child; the deceased person's attorney; or the parent or guardian of a surviving minor child of the deceased. \r\n  \r\n \r\nIf you meet the criteria above you may download the Video Disclosure Request form using the link below.

On May 20, 2024, your office made a partial release of records, delivered by Matthew Gomez. On June 3, 2024, your office closed the request. On June 5, 2020, your office reopened the request when I pointed out you only provided records responsive to one of the two items I sought. Mr. Gomez subsequently sought a date range for the request. On August 23, 2024, I provided that date range. On August 29, 2024, your office notified me that a search produced more then 200 GB of data. On August 30, 2024, I asked for the metadata from these emails in lieu of the emails themselves. On September 6, 2024, your office informed me your IT department could not provide metadata for the emails. You proposed an alternate search methodology aimed at narrowing the results. I accepted that proposal on September 9, 2024. On December 31, 2024, Yvette Gurule informed me the city was experiencing a high volume of requests, and told me I would not receive these records until they became available. On February 10, 2024, your office sent a similar message. This time, you office informed me that if I didn\u2019t respond by February 14, you would close the request. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records associated with processing of my IPRA request by these individuals on these dates, as well as any other processing information, including the communications with your IT department regarding metadata.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

He was charged with burglary, petit theft, resisting an officer without violence, and battery on a law enforcement officer.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nMade initial contact with Morgan inside the Walgreens.\r\nConducted the search and recovered stolen items.\r\nDocumented his statements and resistance to arrest.\r\nTransported Morgan to the police station or jail.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Trump.\r\n\r\nThis request seeks to clarify the extent of New Rochelle Police Department\u2019s involvement in federal immigration enforcement and whether ICE has made requests, conducted operations, or received assistance from NRPD.\r\n\r\nScope of Request: Specific Records Sought\r\n\r\nI request copies of all relevant records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between New Rochelle Police Department and ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, letters, faxes, text messages, internal memos, and reports exchanged between NRPD officers, detectives, supervisors, or administrative personnel and ICE agents or representatives from January 1, 2025, to the present regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests for assistance in immigration enforcement operations in New Rochelle.\r\n\t\u2022\tICE detainers or holds placed on individuals arrested or detained by NRPD.\r\n\t\u2022\tJoint operations, task forces, or coordinated efforts between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicy discussions regarding the role of NRPD in federal immigration enforcement.\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests from ICE for personal data, residency information, or surveillance of specific individuals.\r\n\r\n2. New Rochelle Police Department Policies on ICE and Immigration Enforcement\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all policies, directives, and internal guidelines issued by NRPD regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tProcedures for responding to ICE requests for assistance, detainers, or arrests.\r\n\t\u2022\tLimitations, if any, on sharing information about individuals with federal immigration authorities.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials for officers on handling ICE-related matters, including compliance with New York State\u2019s sanctuary laws.\r\n\t\u2022\tProtocols for handling situations where ICE agents seek access to individuals in police custody.\r\n\r\n3. Agreements, MOUs, and Funding Arrangements with ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), contracts, or agreements between NRPD and ICE, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny formal partnership agreements between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tParticipation in ICE\u2019s 287(g) program or any other federal immigration task forces.\r\n\t\u2022\tFederal grants, funding, or financial incentives received by NRPD related to immigration enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\n4. Records of ICE-Related Enforcement Actions in New Rochelle\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any incident reports, arrest logs, call logs, or visitor logs documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting NRPD facilities or requesting assistance from officers.\r\n\t\u2022\tNRPD officers participating in immigration enforcement operations with ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny individuals arrested, detained, or transferred to ICE custody as a result of NRPD cooperation.\r\n\t\u2022\tComplaints, investigations, or internal reviews regarding potential civil rights violations linked to ICE-related operations.\r\n\r\n5. Metadata for Electronic Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tFor all emails or electronic messages responsive to this request, I request metadata including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient information.\r\n\t\u2022\tTimestamps of messages exchanged.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines and attachment details.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis FOIL request aligns with Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2), which grants the public a presumptive right to access government records. Courts have ruled that law enforcement agencies must disclose non-exempt information to ensure government accountability (Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the public\u2019s right to scrutinize government operations. Given the ongoing national debate over local police cooperation with ICE, the public has a compelling interest in understanding NRPD\u2019s role in immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nNew York State has implemented sanctuary policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, and this request seeks to determine whether NRPD policies comply with these state-level protections (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)).\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve records subject to public disclosure laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves the public interest by promoting government transparency and accountability and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nDue to heightened public concern over immigration enforcement and civil rights issues, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of records affecting public safety and civil liberties is essential for government oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and an estimated timeline for disclosure.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

        "communication": "Jordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, 2025\r\n\r\nTo: Law Department of the City of New Rochelle\r\nNew Rochelle City Hall\r\n515 North Avenue\r\nNew Rochelle, NY 10801\r\n\r\nSubject: FOIL Appeal \u2013 Improper Denial of Records by the New Rochelle Police Department\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nI am formally appealing the denial of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request regarding communications and agreements between the New Rochelle Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The denial was issued under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, this exemption was misapplied, as my request explicitly seeks finalized documents, factual data, and external communications that do not qualify for exemption under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFOIL\u2019s Legislative Intent & Improper Invocation of \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning that all government records are presumed public unless a specific exemption applies. Courts have narrowly construed exemptions to prevent unjustified secrecy. See Westchester Rockland Newspapers, Inc. v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980) (\u201cFOIL is based on a presumption of access, and its exemptions must be narrowly interpreted\u201d).\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g) does not apply here because:\r\n\t1.\tInter-agency or intra-agency communications exemption does not cover factual data, final policies, or external agency interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tI requested communications between the New Rochelle Police Department and ICE, a federal agency, not internal deliberations. Once shared with an external entity, these records are no longer exempt under \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts have ruled that communications exchanged between local police and external federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions. See Matter of City of Newark v. Law Dep\u2019t of the City of New York, 305 A.D.2d 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2003) (holding that communications exchanged between NYPD and federal agencies must be disclosed).\r\n\t2.\tFinal policies, agreements, and MOUs must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL mandates disclosure of final determinations, agreements, or policies.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request explicitly included MOUs and funding arrangements, which are final agency decisions and must be released under New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1543 (Sup. Ct. N.Y.

        "communication": "Jordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, 2025\r\n\r\nTo: Law Department of the City of New Rochelle\r\nNew Rochelle City Hall\r\n515 North Avenue\r\nNew Rochelle, NY 10801\r\n\r\nSubject: FOIL Appeal \u2013 Improper Denial of Records by the New Rochelle Police Department\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nI am formally appealing the denial of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request regarding communications and agreements between the New Rochelle Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The denial was issued under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, this exemption was misapplied, as my request explicitly seeks finalized documents, factual data, and external communications that do not qualify for exemption under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFOIL\u2019s Legislative Intent & Improper Invocation of \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning that all government records are presumed public unless a specific exemption applies. Courts have narrowly construed exemptions to prevent unjustified secrecy. See Westchester Rockland Newspapers, Inc. v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980) (\u201cFOIL is based on a presumption of access, and its exemptions must be narrowly interpreted\u201d).\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g) does not apply here because:\r\n1. Inter-agency or intra-agency communications exemption does not cover factual data, final policies, or external agency interactions.\r\n\u2022 I requested communications between the New Rochelle Police Department and ICE, a federal agency, not internal deliberations. Once shared with an external entity, these records are no longer exempt under \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\u2022 Courts have ruled that communications exchanged between local police and external federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions. See Matter of City of Newark v. Law Dep\u2019t of the City of New York, 305 A.D.2d 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2003) (holding that communications exchanged between NYPD and federal agencies must be disclosed).\r\n2. Final policies, agreements, and MOUs must be disclosed.\r\n\u2022 FOIL mandates disclosure of final determinations, agreements, or policies.\r\n\u2022 My request explicitly included MOUs and funding arrangements, which are final agency decisions and must be released under New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1543 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2017).\r\n\u2022 Any agreements with ICE impact the rights of the public, and withholding them violates Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. NYS Dep\u2019t of Correctional Servs., 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990) (holding that public contracts and agreements must be disclosed).\r\n3. Statistical and factual data are not exempt under FOIL.\r\n\u2022 My request sought records of ICE-related enforcement actions, which contain statistical and factual data and must be released per Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454 (2007) (holding that agencies must disclose factual information even if embedded in otherwise exempt records).\r\n\u2022 Any metadata, timestamps, sender/recipient information, or subject lines of emails between ICE and New Rochelle PD constitute factual records, which are explicitly required to be disclosed under Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n4. Directing me to an online manual does not satisfy FOIL obligations.\r\n\u2022 The response referencing the Manual of Procedure does not satisfy FOIL\u2019s requirement to provide direct access to records.\r\n\u2022 Matter of Thomas v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., 103 A.D.3d 495 (1st Dep\u2019t 2013), explicitly rejected an agency\u2019s attempt to avoid providing records by merely directing requesters to a website.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records & Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\n\r\nI formally demand that the New Rochelle Police Department and City of New Rochelle preserve all responsive records while this appeal is pending. Any destruction, alteration, or deletion of records responsive to this request may constitute a violation of state and federal law.\r\n\u2022 See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that agencies must preserve all records potentially subject to disclosure).\r\n\u2022 Under Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8), any attempt to willfully withhold records in bad faith could lead to judicial intervention and legal penalties.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Disclosure\r\n\r\nGiven the above legal arguments and established case law, I request that the denial be reversed immediately and that the records be provided in electronic format within the statutory timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the records is withheld, I request that you provide a written explanation detailing the legal grounds for withholding, citing specific case law, in compliance with Gould v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of the Department\u2019s rolling production. At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in December 2024.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Batch 1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",
