In the court case, Elhady v. Kable, No. 20-1119 (4th Cir. 2021), the FBI and DOJ stated that as many as 1,400 corporations received the updated TSDS on a regular basis.  Please provide a document or documents that list these corporations by name.  This list is distributed through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), so this is information that is readily available.  There may also be private companies that receive the updated TSDS through eGuardian or iGuardian.  Please provide a document or documents that are current as of April 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWinter Calvert",
