        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request # 1433170-000 for FBI records concerning 065-HQ-57411. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system. Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size. Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process. Small track requests (0-50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete; Medium track requests (51-500 pages) current average time is approximately 41 months to complete; Large track requests (501-4,999 pages) current average time is approximately 67 months to complete; and Extra-large track requests (over 5,000 pages) current average time is approximately 79 months to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA3E3A.AEF77850][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

Please note, due to a software error, the \"fee charged\" has defaulted to zero for each request. There were certain requests from 2024 where the MBTA did charge a fee. If you have questions about any particular request, please let us know. \r\n\r\nIn addition, certain information has been redacted form this record, including dates of birth, license numbers, personal medical information, and the names of any injured parties. This information is exempt from disclosure under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 4, Section 7(26) (c), which exempts materials or data \u201crelating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d. The MBTA has determined that the public interest in the release of this personal information does not outweigh the privacy interests of the individual(s) involved. To the extent that this information falls under the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d under M.G.L. c. 93H and 201 CMR 17.00, it must be  redacted. In addition, the disclosure of personal data is prohibited by the federal Fair Information Practices Act and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 66, Section 2(c) which states, in part, that every holder maintaining personal data shall \"not allow any other agency or individual not employed by the holder to have access to personal data unless such access is authorized by statute or regulations which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter...\" \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in the case of a denial of access to records, you have the right to an administrative appeal to the Supervisor of Records, pursuant to 950 CMR 32.08(1) (the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), and the right to seek judicial review by commencing an action in the Superior Court. \r\n\r\nWe will provide the 2025 requests running to the date of your public records request soon. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulie Ciollo \r\nAssistant General Counsel/ \r\nRecords Access Officer",

I request copies of any memos, studies, or other such records dated Jan 1, 2020, through the date you complete your search, referencing (1) the Justice Department resources spent or expected to be spent litigating Freedom of Information Act cases or (2) the frequency with which the government has won or lost Freedom of Information Act cases.  I'm not looking for individual emails that happen to make mention of these subjects, but rather, more formal studies or other such records that are the results of a more formal evaluation.  I'm happy to discuss the scope with you.  By \"resources\" I mean the costs in terms of attorney/staff hours, FTEs, or salaries.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

After conducting a diligent inquiry and making a thorough search of our records, the District responds as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.  All finalized Comprehensive School Safety Plans submitted from 2018 to present in a word or .pdf file.\r\n                        Please note this Request demands the Los Angeles Unified School District, which has 1,543 schools, provide over 10,000 reports.  Consequently, the records requested have been determined to be exempt pursuant to the following authority:\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     \"A clearly framed request which requires an agency to search an enormous volume of data . . . . or, conversely, a request which compels the production of a huge volume of material may be objectionable as unduly burdensome.\" California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App.4th 159, 166; citing American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 186. \"[C]ourts should not ignore any expense and inconvenience involved in segregating [information].\" California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 1326.  A public agency is not to be subjected to an \"onerous burden\" when disclosing public records. ACLU v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 454.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     Records sought would be exempt pursuant to Government Code \u00a77927.000, which states: \"An agency shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of this division, or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.\"  \"The CPRA provides for more than two dozen specific exemptions, including a \"catchall\" exemption (\u00a7 6255) (now 7922.000). . . . Thus, the Act is clear that the Legislature intended to restrict the public's access to some material.\"  Regents of University of California v. Superior Court (2013) 222 Cal. App. 4th 383, 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     Pursuant to California Government Code section 7922.540(b), Christopher Harris, J.D., Senior Paralegal, Office of the General Counsel, Public Records Act Unit, is the person responsible for the redactions or determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I would also like a compiled excel sheet of all the Comprehensive School Safety Plans on Section 32282 reporting, specifically Section (M)(i) regarding \"Procedures to respond to incidents involving an individual experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest or a similar life-threatening medical emergency while on school grounds.\"\r\nThe District previously responded to this Request in the First Rolling Production.\r\n\r\nWith the production of the above response, the District has completed this matter.\r\nThank you for contacting the Los Angeles Unified School District Public Records Act Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A blue and red logo  Description automatically generated with low confidence]\r\nChristopher Harris, J.D., Senior Paralegal\r\nLos Angeles Unified School District, Office of General Counsel\r\n333 S.

There are three types of responsive information, and most records contain a combination. \u00a0First, available non-protected responsive records. \u00a0Second, information the Texas Attorney General previously determined confidential (see attached) and any information the Irving ISD determines is protected from disclosure by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). \u00a0The Irving ISD will automatically redact this protected information prior to disclosure. \u00a0If your request only addresses these two types of information, as soon as practicable you will be contacted about the availability of the requested records (no records found or date of production and potential costs) and/or provided with copies of the records in question as redacted. A third type of responsive information may be covered by a discretionary exception to the PIA such as, but not limited to, attorney-client and/or attorney work product privileges. \u00a0The district is not allowed to automatically withhold or redact this information but must first seek a ruling from the Attorney General. \u00a0Such a petition shall be sent to the Attorney General and you within ten days of your request being received by the Irving ISD, but can ultimately delay the process since the Attorney General has 45 days to respond to the district\u2019s request. \u00a0Therefore, we ask you to agree the Irving ISD may redact any attorney client, litigation, or attorney work product deemed necessary by law without seeking a ruling from the Attorney General. If your request is for student directory information, please note that our district policy FL(Local) only designates the student name, enrollment/withdraw dates, campus(es) attended, current grade level, and graduation status. \u00a0No other information will be released in compliance with FERPA; therefore, we will not produce the such information as student addresses or phone numbers. \u00a0If you have requested such information, we request that you please clarify/revise your request in compliance with our district policy. If at any time during this process you feel the Irving ISD has not responded in accordance with the PIA, you may contact the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Hotline toll-free at (877) 673-6839 (877-OPENTEX) or in the Austin area at (512) 478-6736 (478-OPEN). You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and will receive an email when your request has been completed. Again, thank you for using the Irving ISD Request Center. The Texas Public Information Act does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions.

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 1, please visit the following website for records responsive to this portion of your request:\u00a0https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccon.viewrecord&amp;contractnum=C-145843\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 2, the Department has completed its review and is providing you with a record responsive to this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 exempt records and/or information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive emails containing personal information (i.e., personal signatures and account numbers) are being provided to you with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to items 3, 4, 6, and 7, please note that our office\u2014the LAPD Public Records and Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\u2014does not house the records you are seeking. The Department is in the process of searching for the requested records. Please note that some of the records to be provided, if any, may be redacted pursuant to California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000. We will provide an update by January 24, 2025, and will notify you should anything change.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 5, the Department has conducted a search based on the information provided and no responsive records were located.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Hopkins",

To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't \r\nof the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations \r\nof HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records \r\ncreated, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, \r\nincluding but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to \r\nthe University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, \r\nenvironmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, \r\ntesting dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska \r\nsite) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of \r\nclassified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W.

Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the \r\n*Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, \r\nNavy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, \r\nplease: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; \r\n(2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide \r\na detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 \r\nU.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld \r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, \r\ncontributing to understanding government research programs and transparency \r\nin ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they \r\nexceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and \r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform \r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Superior Court&nbsp;(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the request seeks records containing personal information, including identifiable health information, or information that constitutes an unwarranted invasion of a person\u2019s privacy interest, such as credit card information, this information is exempt from disclosure under Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.700 and 7923.700.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the requests seek documents containing information gathered as part of an individual criminal investigation case file or intelligence file, these records are exempt from disclosure under Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 7923.600 and 7927.705 and Evidence Code \u00a7\u00a7 1040(b)(2) and 1041.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo the extent the requests seek records that are not part of an individual criminal investigation or intelligence file but would reveal the City\u2019s operational/technical strategies, confidential informants, the public interest in not disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in disclosing, since releasing such records to the public would jeopardize public safety, the safety of allied public safety agencies and the ability of the police to safely implement safety and security measures to protect the community.&nbsp;Furthermore, disclosure of this information to the public would allow individuals to defeat or avoid the City\u2019s efforts regarding public and officer safety, property protection, and apprehension of fleeing suspects.&nbsp;As a result, this information is exempt from disclosure under Government \u00a7 7922.000 and Evidence Code \u00a7 1040(b)(2).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf there are records you feel should be disclosed notwithstanding this response, or you would like to discuss your requests and this response further, please respond using this portal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* PRA 25-147814 Aug 2025 to 17 Aug 2025.xlsx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocument links are valid for one month.\r\n                   After October 10, you will need to sign in to view the document(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Fremont.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nProduct brochures, Powerpoint presentations, flyers and other promotional business documents about defense and technology company Nice Systems Ltd. -- also known as \"NICE\" or \"NICE's Cyber and Intelligence division\" or \"CYBERBIT LTD\" or  \"CYBERBIT\" or \"Elbit Systems Ltd.\" -- describing products and/or services relating to offensive cybersecurity, surveillance, electronic warfare, virtual operations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The focus of the requests involves product documents that may carry terminology/keywords/descriptions such as: Computer Network Operations (CNO), Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Computer Network Attacks (CNA), cyber intelligence and signals intelligence (SIGINT). NICE is an Israeli/American technology contractor that sells surveillance and internet monitoring capabilities. The firm has offices around the world, including in the United States, but it is primarily managed from Israel. NICE is known for producing high-tech products for national security and law enforcement agencies to help them conduct surveillance against threats, including terrorism and criminal entities. NICE' cyber and intelligence division was acquired by Elbit Systems Ltd., via a subsidiary called CYBERBIT, in 2015; meaning that references to NICE's technology may carry that name as well, especially more recently. \r\n\r\nThis FOIA seeks any materials produced by the contractor to explain/sell/market their cyber intelligence capabilities/offerings to the U.S. government between the years 2014 and 2020 (or the current date of review). Such material would be likely held/controlled by the appropriate business contracting office within the agency and/or other divisions that make purchase/contracting decisions. NICE/Elbit have tried to sell their products to various different US security organizations in the past.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristopher Bing\n\n",
