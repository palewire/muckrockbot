FOIA is not a search mechanism.\u00a0 Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\u00a0 For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. \nThe FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \nThis is not a denial of your request for records. Please resubmit your FOIA request, along with a more detailed description of the records being sought, by logging into your existing FOIAOnline account or creating an account at https://foiaonline.gov. (https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

The list would need to be reviewed for any cases that may have been sealed or expunged. Please advise if you would like us to send a deposit letter.\r\nIn regards to items 2, each file that is applicable to your request would need to be manually pulled and reviewed for any potential exemptions and/or redactions that may be necessary.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI received your request for \"unedited videos\" from the Nicolae Miu case. This is NOT something I could release to you legally as all videos WILL be edited and redacted. There were many juveniles in this case and juveniles are a protected class, as well as victims who are protected under Marsy's Law. Below is the letter that explains all redactions made to all videos relating to the Nicolae Miu case. The cost to receive this request is just shy of $20 and it is far too large to send electronically. Please let me know if you are still interested in receiving the case file that was sent out to all requesters; media and otherwise, and I will send a flash drive and invoice around March. Thank you,\r\n\r\nDear Records Requester:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your request for records regarding St. Croix County Sheriff's Office case SO2022006400. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office does have records that meet your request. The Spanish language interviews are included in these records.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stats \u00a7\u00a7938.396(1)(c)2 law enforcement records involving a juvenile may be released to another party only with the written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, or the juvenile themselves, if the juvenile is 14 years or older. I did not receive a single written consent form with any of your requests for records; therefore, all videos, photos, and reports mentioning or showing juveniles under the age of eighteen have been redacted or removed from the case files prior to release. The only exception I have knowingly made is that I have kept the deceased victim, Isaac Schuman's name only intact throughout. In applying the balancing act, disclosure of this already publicly named victim outweighs the interest in non-disclosure of this information. Pursuant to Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, \u00b626, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. The public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime-especially children affected by very sensitive crimes-weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\r\n\r\nWell-established public policy recognizes the privacy rights of a deceased person's surviving loved ones. Cf. National Archives and Records Admin. V. Favish, 540 U.S. 157, 168, 171-72 (2004). In preparing these records for release, the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test was applied, and the public interest in treating loved ones of the deceased individual with respect for their privacy and dignity outweighed any public interest in disclosure of any graphic images in photographs and videos of Isaac Schuman; therefore any images of Isaac and his family have been removed or redacted prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pertaining to the release of law enforcement records, the harm to the public interest caused by the release of identities of victims of crimes overrides the public interest in release. Based on Marsy's Law, there is a strong public policy favoring nondisclosure of some of the requested records for the protection of the victims detailed within the reports. The policy implications as set forth in Article I, Section 9m of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 950.01 is that all victims of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, sensitivity, and privacy. \u00a7 950.04(1v)(dr) states victims of all crimes have the following rights: (dr) to not have his or her personal identifiers, as defined in s. 85.103 (1) used or disclosed by a public official, employee, or agency for a purpose that is unrelated to the official responsibilities of the official, employee, or agency. In addition, there is a strong public interest favoring nondisclosure which outweighs the public interest in disclosure based on the potential for further victimization of the innocent victims. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)1 - 1. It shall be the public policy of this state to maintain the privacy of a record subject who is a victim of a sensitive or violent crime and access to data from a body camera used by a law enforcement officer that records such a record subject shall be provided only if the public interest in allowing access is so great as to outweigh that public policy. Our department has received no signed consent forms allowing release of these victims' private information. Records will not be released that contain personal information regarding several stabbing victims from this case.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims and respect their personal information, victim names and images have been redacted.\r\n\r\nIn performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of persons collaterally mentioned in a law enforcement report outweighs any legitimate public interest in information about the conduct of governmental affairs. Furthermore, I determined that the public interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals, and in facilitating cooperation with law enforcement in sensitive investigations, also outweigh any public interest in disclosure of this described information. Any notebooks, reports, computer screens, audio, or video that may contain this information may be pixelated, muted, beeped out, blacked out, blurred, redacted, or removed. Additionally, the following statutes were applied in reviewing and consideration of releasing these records:\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Dates of birth, phone numbers, driver's license number, passport numbers, social security numbers and addresses for which we have not received a waiver to release have been redacted to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In performing the public records balancing test, pursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(a), I concluded that the public policy in favor of protecting the confidentiality of individual's identifiable information and preventing its misuse upon any subsequent disclosure, as well as the public polices outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7\u00a7 801.19, 801.20 and 801.21, outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the dates of birth, driver's license/state ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses or social security numbers of individual persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   \"Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 146.82, the St. Croix County's Sheriff's Office is not disclosing records that contain protected health information (PHI).\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2 governs people with a reasonable expectation of privacy pictured in law enforcement body camera recordings so some people's images, especially within the hospital, have been protected. Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a751.30 and 19.35, medical information has been redacted or omitted. Medical records may be omitted from release as outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7146.82.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.30(4)(a), records related to mental health welfare checks are confidential and cannot be released except to the subject of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Cellphone extraction records are being withheld. After conducting the balancing test, I have determined that there is a strong public interest against disclosure that outweighs the interest in disclosure in order to protect the privacy of individuals who may be included in the cellphone extraction records that are unrelated to the case/incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 534, information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wisconsin Department of Justice that is entered into the Crime Information Bureau is not being disclosed. Specifically, 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1) indicates that information from national crime information databases consisting of identification records, criminal history records, protection orders, and wanted person records may be disseminated to civil or criminal courts for use in domestic violence or stalking cases. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit access to such records for any other purpose. Therefore, any information obtained from the national crime information database is redacted and not being disclosed, pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a719.36(13), personal and business financial account information is considered personal and confidential and has been redacted. Any and all invoices and bank related reports have been removed from your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7165.79, Crime Lab analysis of evidence obtained from law enforcement officers are not subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Personal cell telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which are economically valuable individually identifiable information, were redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In applying the balancing test, DOJ determined the public interest in protecting this economically valuable individually identifiable information from misappropriation or misuse outweighs any public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2, the public's interest in disclosure of other jail inmates is not outweighed by the public interest in non-disclosure. Jail inmates who are not the subject of the record have an expectation of privacy in the jail.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any video which has been redacted to the point there is nothing of value left to release has been omitted from this release.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records laws exist to ensure an open and transparent government. The personal communication of an inmate does not affect government business operations unless it involves a potential safety or security issue as identified in DOC 309.39. Although the inmate is informed of the recordings  of the calls, he or she would likely to be reluctant to communicate if these records were disclosed as a public record. This impact on communication if treated as a releasable public record would undermine the rehabilitative aspect of maintaining communication between the inmate and the inmate's family, friends, government officials, courts and people concerned with the welfare of the inmate. Open communication fosters reintegration into the community and the maintenance of family ties. It motivates the inmate and contributes to the morale and security of the inmate and staff. For these reasons the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office has determined that any of Nicolae Miu's phone calls, video logs, visitation reports, or activities from within our jail are not being released with your request for records.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be more information about law enforcement records pursuant to this request, but the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is not the legal custodian of those records.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DB5A94.6CA98430]\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\n\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\n\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov<mailto:Tammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

We do not use those types of numbers or labeling to mark any of our videos. Please feel free to call me if you would like to explain further what it is you are looking for. Again, there were several juveniles and victims in the Nicolae Miu case, so the videos are very heavily redacted.\r\n\r\nWe are very limited to how much cloud storage we are allotted, and I am a one-woman records department who has handled more than 2,500 requests for records so far this year. We have determined that agency requests must take precedence for what we can send electronically as we work with several other law enforcement agencies in order to handle important cases. Any costs are based on our actual cost of producing the records requested so the cost is only for the cost of the flash drive and the postage.\r\n\r\nYour request is in my queue; however, there are almost thirty requests received prior and request for videos are handled in the order in which they are received.

If so, I have released the same release to every single requester after having it approved by my Captain and our Corporation Counsel. I have no additional videos to provide towards this request. If you are referring to a different case, please let me know and I can look into this further. Many, many people have released videos from the Nicolae Miu case. Clerk of Courts and other police departments may have additional videos to offer, but everything our department is releasing has been released.  Some videos names changed after redactions so I am unable to determine which officer's footage they came from. But I have NO other information to provide or release relating to the Nicolae Miu case.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the thousand oaks police Department\u2019s use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the Department\u2019s use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the department\u2019s aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the department used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the Department\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny documents pertaining to the \"City Storage Program Policy\" as described by \"An Ordinance to amend Ch. 24 by adding a new section relative to Camping\" section 24-31(g)(i): \"The Salem Police Chief shall establish, and from time to time amend, a City Storage Program Policy not inconsistent with this ordinance.\" Including current and prior versions of the written copy of the \"City Storage Program Policy\" as pursuant to 24-31(g)(v), any amendments to the current written copy of the \"City Storage Program Policy\", and any notes kept regarding the current written copy of the \"City Storage Program Policy\" from the Salem Police Department since the establishment of \"An Ordinance to amend Ch. 24 by adding a new section relative to Camping\" to the date this request was sent, January 13, 2025.\r\n\r\nAs well as,\r\n\r\nAll documents from the June 26, 2024 dispersal of the 'South River encampment' pertaining to \"reasonable and documented attempts\" made by \"City staff\" to identify owners of \"property\" that was left at the South River encampment as a result of this June 26 dispersal that was \"not claimed by any person within 24 hours of it being deemed by the City as being unclaimed\" in which case \"City staff\" are to \"assess whether the property is abandoned property or an individual\u2019s temporarily unattended property through reasonable and documented attempts to identify the property owner\" as is required of the \"City Storage Program Policy\" pursuant to 24-31(g)(iii).\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. I am currently a student journalist at Emerson College and have reported about the South River encampment in the past. As these records pertain to the transparency of our public officials in the treatment of homeless community members on public grounds, I would request the fees for this request be waived on the grounds of clear public interest as is suggested by the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. As section 24-31(g)(vii) lays out how fees should not be charged in regards to processing claims in filing appeals to recover property pursuant to the \"City Storage Program Policy,\" I would ask that this standard be extended to this request as it is not made in the commercial interest but in the interest of transparency regarding the same policy. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and will not be made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Nu\u00f1ez",

Burke who oversees the CIU (Community Impact Unit):\r\n\r\nAll individuals were aware that the site was being closed and had ample time to remove any property that they wished.  Anyone who wanted to have the PD store property would have been able to do so.  Not one individual requested we store their personal property.  This was not unexpected as most individuals, housed or unhoused, do not want to turn over their possessions to the police.  However, we were on site to do so on the date of the closure.  Again, no one wanted to give officers property.\r\n\r\nThe remaining items (tents, furniture, misc. Items, etc.) were so highly contaminated by human waste and hypodermic needles that it would not be permissible to store at the station safely.\r\n\r\nOfficers also asked individuals if they had everything they wanted to retrieve.\r\n\r\nNo one has come forward to tell us that any property that was wanted was disposed of.\r\n\r\nAlso lastly, there is mention of the property in the report.  That would be our documentation.  There would be no separate report.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this office can be of any other assistance, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to challenge any aspect of this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records following the procedure set forth in 950 C.M.R. 32.08, a copy of which is available at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/law-lib/laws-by-source/cmr/<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%252Fcourts%252Fcase-legal-res%252Flaw-lib%252Flaws-by-source%252Fcmr%252F%26data%3deJxljM0KgzAQhJ_G3BJsI0oPOXhpS699gjWuUcmPZGODb99Ij4VhmBk-Rqu26bpBtvJWTxdko9IxZL94mhe0o9DBMaee2KyvvnsfDxMZKTAR0WPV1AQW3TYKj4lFtU7goKz_F7uaU9oq2VfXe1HOWTggEiZ8StVhj4nOAITcogHLI56DhcztMvwS8eHgVFiNJ-ti8S9s8kFM&c=E,1,9wSSFxRFBoCPkfGE9giAhbeiiMiNeJa2thFtN3KO3mXdBru7FvRDbyhMmQdWKzs3wlXwPj0Dh1DNotHM_IJRgAK8YD9z6um0cWRVDQpA&typo=1>\r\n\r\nCode of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR)<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%252Fcourts%252Fcase-legal-res%252Flaw-lib%252Flaws-by-source%252Fcmr%252F%26data%3deJxljM0KgzAQhJ_G3BJsI0oPOXhpS699gjWuUcmPZGODb99Ij4VhmBk-Rqu26bpBtvJWTxdko9IxZL94mhe0o9DBMaee2KyvvnsfDxMZKTAR0WPV1AQW3TYKj4lFtU7goKz_F7uaU9oq2VfXe1HOWTggEiZ8StVhj4nOAITcogHLI56DhcztMvwS8eHgVFiNJ-ti8S9s8kFM&c=E,1,v7NE_uyG8VFLvYWukT6C3dwdLAUrAZeLSCp1xsMsjbx4x_v-kFGKPOPoEbbaQo8Yjj5Ud6_6_EGae0KjmKeH3r_9X0r7qL8C3h3ihjbDz3rOCpLLnw,,&typo=1>\r\n\r\nFind regulations issued by all state agencies by number or by subject.\r\n\r\nwww.mass.gov<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flinklock.titanhq.com%2fanalyse%3furl%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mass.gov%26data%3deJxlzLEOwiAQgOGngZFUISUON3RR4-oTnHClbXrQAJb07e1u8k_f8DvojbUf3etbN15IenA5tTjHMs20euUSS4YnmeU12PfxCFkWwJCJIgnTFVyJN68iVZlhGZHx1P_FF6ZaN6EHcb2ftdYUYykqpP0HF5osUg%2525%2525&c=E,1,J8BH6Hbh5FcyZ_VbsuXCkaL3NU3YvdsRBxjBl1xgB3R8mTzT6x46q1hERPJgRbJ_p2WiLtGu8VpD4cLl28l0OnacnlFYrS_HYQlwKnjg-fi1Z01xiOMOIptUCKo,&typo=1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Marie Greene\r\n\r\nPrincipal Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport Services - Records Division\r\n\r\nSalem Police Department\r\n\r\n95 Margin St Salem Ma 01970\r\n\r\n978-744-0171 ext 50132\r\n\r\nagreene@salempd.net<mailto:agreene@salempd.net>\r\n\r\nRecords Division Homepage<https://www.salem.com/salem-police-department/contact-us/pages/public-records-requests>\r\nSalem Police Department Homepage<https://www.salem.com/salem-police-department>\r\nA Guide to Massachusetts Public Records Law<https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf>\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Services Window Hours of Operations:\r\n\r\nRecords Inquiry Request Form Click Here<https://www.salemma.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif7986/f/uploads/public_records_request_form_pdf.pdf>\r\n\r\nMondays 9a-3p\r\n\r\nTuesdays 9a-3p\r\n\r\nThursdays 11a-7p\r\n\r\nFridays 9a-12p\r\n\r\n[cid:9cb9cb15-d903-4298-abd1-39cd833de12c]\n",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

DCJS received a deposit for an outstanding previous FOIA request from you and/or your organization on March 3, 2025, and processed this request beginning on that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached to this email, you will find an Excel spreadsheet that contains the number of certified officers and/or jailers at each law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth. However, please be aware that contrary to the language used in your FOIA request, Virginia does not license officers; Virginia only certifies officers. In addition, DCJS does not have information on the total employees of each Virginia law enforcement agency, only the certified law enforcement officers reported to DCJS by the individual agencies.  Accordingly, pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3704.B(3) DCJS responds that no such records exist regarding the total employees of each Virginia law enforcement agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you requested, this information has been provided \"in a machine-readable database or spreadsheet format such as Excel...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPayne Tarkenton\r\n\r\nFOIA Officer\r\n\r\nVirginia Department of Criminal Justice Services\r\n\r\n1100 Bank Street, Richmond, VA 23219\r\n\r\nPhone 804-786-3051\r\n\r\nwww.dcjs.virginia.gov<http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor up to date information, subscribe to \"DCJS Updates\": www.dcjs.virginia.gov/subscribe<http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/subscribe>\r\nVisit us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/vadcjs<http://www.facebook.com/vadcjs> and Flickr: www.flickr.com/photos/va_dcjs<http://www.flickr.com/photos/va_dcjs>\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:\r\nThe contents of this email message and any attachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain confidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected from disclosure.

For example, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (2019), the court ruled that the government could not withhold or redact records related to the CIA's use of drone strikes. Additionally, in Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science and Technology Policy (2020), the court ruled that the government must release certain records related to climate change policy.\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to the following records:\r\n\r\nArchitectural drawings and blueprints of The Cadet Chapel, including any revisions or updates made over the past 10 years.\r\nRecords related to the construction and maintenance of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any contracts or agreements with contractors and vendors.\r\nRecords related to the funding of The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including any budget reports or financial statements.\r\nAny records related to events or ceremonies held at The Cadet Chapel over the past 10 years, including guest lists, program materials, and photographs.\r\nTo facilitate your search for the requested documents, please let me know if there are any specific offices or departments that may hold the requested documents.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you do not redact, withhold, or delete any responsive records. If any documents are withheld or redacted, I will seek a court order to compel their release. Please note that the government's obligation to disclose records under FOIA is a cornerstone of transparency and accountability, and I urge you to fully comply with my request.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make a special request for any records related to the history and significance of The Cadet Chapel at West Point. As a landmark building with a rich history, I am interested in learning more about the cultural and historical significance of The Cadet Chapel, and any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department conducted a query and has identified email communications that are currently under review for any information exempt under various provisions of the CPRA.

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of the Department\u2019s rolling production. At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in January 2025.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Government Code Sections 7927.700 and 7927.705. Section 7927.700 exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Section 7927.705 exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to provisions of the Penal Code. Penal Code Section 832.7(a) states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code. Therefore, we are denying your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld or are being provided to you with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not part of the Department's conduct of business are being withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in accordance with the California Government Code, Section 7923.600, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes are exempt from disclosure. Therefore, records that contain investigatory records or records properly part of investigative files are withheld or are being provided to you with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Batch 1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1.

Duplicates from each year do not need to be completed. At a minimum, photos for 2023 - 2024 should be included.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego County Sheriff's Office responded on January 31, 2025, and incorporates the previous response.\r\n\r\nThe San Diego County Sheriff's Office is providing the sworn personnel roster for 2016 through 2023 to include names, and station. The names of deputies who work in undercover, plain clothes positions that demand anonymity were removed pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000. Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.4th 278, 301 (2007). The anonymity of these deputies is essential to their safety and effectiveness, and warrants exempting their identity and information about their position from disclosure. The public interest served by not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the information.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request to include badge numbers, serial numbers, currently no roster with the information sought in the format you have requested exists. Historical reports do not include badge numbers.  A public agency is not required to generate new substantive content or create inventories of data in response to a records request. Sander v. Superior Court (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651.  Therefore, the Sheriff's Office is providing the rosters with names and stations.\r\n\r\nYour request is now closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErica Duarte, Administrative Analyst\r\n\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\"",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations) \r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.\u00a0 Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations,\u00a0CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\u00a0 Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 Currently, the average time to process a FOIA request related to \"travel/border incidents\" is a minimum of 2-4 months. We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/facial-recognition-technology. Specifically, page 31 of the section 'Facial Recognition Part 1' (https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2024-Apr/Facial Recognition Part 1.pdf) \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2020-041143 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

        "communication": "Dear Requester, \r\n  \r\n Thank you for your follow up letter attached, received by our Department on March 11, 2025. \r\n  \r\n Video Footage (Body Worn Camera) \r\n  \r\n North Carolina General Statute Section 132-1.4A provides the process by which a person may obtain a copy of law enforcement recordings at this Link.. In order to obtain a copy of a video, you must first initiate a civil action or file a Petition For Release (AOC form CV-270) with the Mecklenburg County Clerk of Court. Once the Petition for Release has been filed with the courthouse, a file-stamped copy of the Petition may be served on CMPD through the Police Attorney's office at: CMPD Police Attorney office 601 E Trade St Charlotte, NC 28202 \r\n  \r\n Disclosure of Recordings (Viewing ONLY) \r\n  \r\n As noted above, N.C.G.S. 132-1.4A also states that certain persons are entitled to disclosures, or viewings, of law enforcement recordings. This does not include getting a copy of the recordings. By statute, those persons are: \r\n  \r\n A person whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A spouse if the spouse whose image or voice is in the recording consents to the disclosure. Notarization of the request form is required by the consenting spouse. \r\n An attorney retained to represent a person whose image or voice is in the recording. Notarization of the request form by the client is required. \r\n A parent of a minor whose image or voice is in the recording. \r\n A guardian of a minor or adult whose image or voice is in the recording. Guardianship documentation is required. \r\n A personal representative of a deceased person whose image or voice is in the recording. Executorship, Power of Attorney, or other legal documentation required. \r\n A personal representative of an adult person who is incapacitated and unable to provide consent to disclosure. Power of Attorney or other legal documentation required. \r\n  \r\n NOTE: the statute defines a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d as a parent, court-appointed guardian, spouse, or attorney of a person whose image or voice is in the recording. If a person whose image or voice is in the recording is deceased, the term also means the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person; the deceased person's surviving spouse, parent, or adult child; the deceased person's attorney; or the parent or guardian of a surviving minor child of the deceased. \r\n  \r\n \r\nIf you meet the criteria above you may download the Video Disclosure Request form using the link below. Once you have completed the form in its entirety you may bring it, along with the required verification documents, to any CMPD division office or the Law Enforcement Center. You may also email the form and documentation to VideoDisclosure@cmpd.org or you may mail the form and documentation by USPS to: \r\n  \r\n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\r\nAttn: Video Disclosure\r\n601 East Trade Street Charlotte, NC 28202 \r\n  \r\n \r\nIf you would like to view a recording that depicts death or serious bodily injury, the statute requires you to complete a Request to Law Enforcement Agency to Disclose Recording of Death or Serious Bodily Injury (AOC form CV-275). This completed form can be sent directly to CMPD through the Police Attorney\u2019s Office.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the statute or the video request processes described above, you should visit www.nccourts.gov or contact a private attorney to assist you.\r\n\r\nDownload the Video Disclosure Request Form\r\n\r\nView the NC General Statute - Chapter 132 \u00a71.4A \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\r\nPublic Records Request Unit\r\nPolice Attorney\u2019s Office\r\n601 East Trade Street\r\nCharlotte, NC 28202\r\nwww.cmpd.org",

On May 20, 2024, your office made a partial release of records, delivered by Matthew Gomez. On June 3, 2024, your office closed the request. On June 5, 2020, your office reopened the request when I pointed out you only provided records responsive to one of the two items I sought. Mr. Gomez subsequently sought a date range for the request. On August 23, 2024, I provided that date range. On August 29, 2024, your office notified me that a search produced more then 200 GB of data. On August 30, 2024, I asked for the metadata from these emails in lieu of the emails themselves. On September 6, 2024, your office informed me your IT department could not provide metadata for the emails. You proposed an alternate search methodology aimed at narrowing the results. I accepted that proposal on September 9, 2024. On December 31, 2024, Yvette Gurule informed me the city was experiencing a high volume of requests, and told me I would not receive these records until they became available. On February 10, 2024, your office sent a similar message. This time, you office informed me that if I didn\u2019t respond by February 14, you would close the request. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records associated with processing of my IPRA request by these individuals on these dates, as well as any other processing information, including the communications with your IT department regarding metadata.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Maria Guinnip.",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",
