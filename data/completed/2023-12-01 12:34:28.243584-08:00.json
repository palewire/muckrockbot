        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).

All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, that was written by or sent to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present date that contains the following words or phrases:\r\n\u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cballot(s)\u201d, \u201celection fraud\u201d, and \u201cballot fraud\u201d\r\n2. All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, to and from the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present that has a subject matter relating to \u201coperational changes\u201d\r\n3. All memos and correspondence written to or from the office of the Inspector General from 5/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201corganizational changes\u201d, and \u201c2020 election\u201d\r\n4. All email correspondence between high-ranking officials at USPS from 7/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201cchanges\u201d, \u201cethics\u201d, \u201ccomplaints\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, and \u201corganizational changes\u201d\r\n5. All data sheets from 5/1/2020 that describe organizational changes in the operation of the United States Postal Service\r\n6. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to the present \r\n7. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020\r\nFee Waiver:\r\nI hereby request that all fees be waived as this is a matter of public interest.\r\n1. The records that are being requested concerns \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d. This is since the Postmaster General acts as the decision making body that is in charge of determining whether changes are to be made inside the United States Postal Service. Also, the OIG acts as a watchdog over USPS and thus is in and of itself participating in \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d.\r\n2. The documents requested will contribute to the understanding of the stated \u201coperation or activities of the government\u201d. The documents requested will allow for insight into the decision for the USPS to be processing mail more slowly and alerting that mail-in ballots might not get to voters on time. There have been calls made by members of Congress to investigate said activities as well. This significance of said records have been demonstrated through various news outlets as well as a letter by a senator.\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-letter-usps-practices/index.html\r\n3. The records requested directly impacts millions of Americans that will be voting by mail in the upcoming election. This is since these records will provide insight into how mail-in voting will operate through the United States Postal Service. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many Americans will decide to vote by mail instead of voting in person. In a survey conducted in May 2020, 64% of Americans were in favor of voting by mail (https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx). These records will allow the public to determine whether or not it will be the best option to vote by mail. This is since these records can show or not show whether or not the systematic changes in the United States Postal Service will have a direct impact on whether a voter decides to vote by mail or not. This will also allow for due diligence to be made by states in order to make sure that every vote is counted in the appropriate manner. The documents will be available publicly and will be disseminated across news outlets in order to inform the public. \r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html\r\n4. The documents requested will allow for a clear understanding of \u201cthe operations and activities of government\u201d. Presently, the public doesn\u2019t have information to evaluate as to whether the changes made in USPS will impact how mail-in voting will occur in the upcoming election. This is since there is no information that is readily available as it is breaking news and has recently been covered by news outlets. Currently, the Speaker of the House is requesting a hearing where the present Postmaster General is requested to appear and testify (https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html). These documents will be able to direct the course of the congressional hearing as it will give insight into the changes in operation at the United States Postal Service.\r\nExpedited Processing\r\n1. I hereby request expedited processing for this request as well. I am not a member of the news media however I am submitting this request through a platform (Muckrock.com), whose primary purpose is to disseminate information. As such, the mode of disseminating information is valid as meeting the first prong for being \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public regarding the requested documents. The current subject matter is ongoing as shown through various news outlets covering the story. This is an urgent matter to all Americans as it directly relates to the processing of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election.\r\nList:\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-demand-postmaster-general-usps-chairman-testify-urgently-on-sabotage-of-postal-service.amp\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/trump-administration-postal-service-elections/index.html\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/taylor-swift-slams-trumps-calculated-dismantling-usps-rcna83\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/08/15/902811968/trump-offers-conflicting-statements-on-mail-in-voting-usps-funding\r\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/13/us-postal-service-whats-going-post-office-what-we-know/3360565001/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/usps-vote-mail.html\r\n2. This is currently a breaking news story whose value would be diminished without these records. Also, there is currently a pending request to have the Postmaster General appear in Congress in order to testify. The previous news releases demonstrates the urgency in obtaining these records.\r\n3. The requested records clearly concerns federal government activity. This is since the records will explain the process taken that has caused USPS to have organizational changes. Also, it will determine whether there was any wrongdoing based on possible records that will show communications with specific words that will be instrumental in evaluating the decisions made by the Postmaster General.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarlos Gamez\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Gamez:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your August 17 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for records related to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to Postmaster General (PMG) Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"mail in ballots\", \"2020 election\", \"ballot(s)\", \"election fraud\", \"ballot fraud\".\r\n  2.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to PMG Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present having a subject matter relating to \"operational changes\".\r\n  3.  Memos or correspondence written to or from the OIG from 5/1/2020 to present containing \"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\".\r\n  4.  Email correspondence between high-ranking officials at the U.S. Postal Service from 7/1/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"Louis DeJoy\", \"changes\", \"ethics\", \"complaints\", \"2020 election\", \"mail in ballots\", and \"organizational changes\".\r\n  5.  All data sheets from 5/1/2020 describing organizational changes in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n  6.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n  7.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgement is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office, along with the St Louis Requester Service Center, is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Information on the USPIS is available on the Internet at: https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \"oversight authority\" for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause records related to items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 would be potentially maintained by the Postal Service, we have referred your request to their FOIA office for processing and direct response to you. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them online at https://pfoiapal.usps.com/, via email at foia12@usps.gov<mailto:foia12@usps.gov>, via phone at (202) 268-2608, via fax at (202) 268-5353, or in writing at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Service Records Office\r\n\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P830\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20260-4541\r\n\r\nRegarding item #3, in order for us to process this portion of your request, under C.F.R. Title 39 \u00a7 265.3(c) requires requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Therefore, we will need you to please provide a listing of the names of any OIG employees you wish us to search against. Limiting the number of names you provide will substantially increase the time it takes to locate and process any responsive records.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive the listing of OIG employee names, in order to conduct an adequate search for these records, we would need to do a data transfer of the entire mailbox of each individual you choose to name (to include inbox, sent items, and deleted items) and place these data files in a secure location. At this point, FOIA staff will be able to conduct key word search of \"\"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\", and/or any other search term you may suggest.  We would then need to review each data file for responsiveness before conducting a line-by-line examination to determine what information may be released in accordance with FOIA regulations. We understand this portion of your request to be for memos or correspondence related to \"organizational changes\" recently in the news at the Postal Service, not the OIG. Be advised e-mails are not considered an established system of records under the Privacy Act and would be considered for release only under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive a listing of named OIG employee profiles by COB September 15, we will presume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request and will close your file, but you may file again later. You may return the completed form via e-mail at foia@uspsoig.gov<mailto:foia@uspsoig.gov> or U.S. Mail at 1735 N. Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

The FOIA allows agencies twenty (20) working days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) to process requests.  In unusual circumstances, agencies may qualify for further extensions, and may request a modified FOIA request and/or time frame for response.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\n\r\n\u201cUnusual circumstances\u201d apply to the processing of a request if one or more of the following apply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another department or agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii).\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as timely notice that unusual circumstances apply to your request as a result of item outlined above. As such, we are extending the response period until December 2, 2022, instead of September 30, 2022, as stated in my previous correspondence.  You will be contacted on or immediately after that date.\r\n\r\nAgain, please accept my apologies for the delay response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nNancy P.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

At least one such institution may have weighed that in the past few years while choosing to publicly acknowledge the risk of airborne transmission, and decided to keep said information quiet in an attempt at reducing legal exposure. Thus, it would be curious and greatly effect the public if such analysis was done in our jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf records other than reports are available, such as emails and memos, I would appreciate their search and inclusion where possible.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

        "communication": "To whom this may concern,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you to appeal a recent response from a records request I made to the Town of Blackstone\u2019s records officer.\r\n\r\nOn 1/25/2023, pursuant to Massachusetts General Law Chapter 66, Section 10, I requested the following information (original request is attached): \u201cAny internal police investigations from 2016-present and supporting documentation including procurement processes, scope, and related emails from the TA, town counsel, and pertinent boards\u201d.  In addition, I requested specific internal police department investigations that were performed by external investigators that included: \u201cPaul White, Al Donovan, Paul L'Italien, and Frank Santin\u201d.\r\n\r\nOn 2/23/2023, I received as response through email from the records officer Ms. Vecchio stating \u201cGood morning: I respectfully request that you look on the Town of Blackstone website for this information. Thank you. Dori\u201d.  On 3/3/2023, I sent a follow up email that stated \u201cI checked the town website and the only investigation I could find was the Paul L'Italien one and that was only the summary. Are the other police investigations that were in the request on the website? If so, could you point me in the right direction?\u201d.  After this email, I received no further correspondence on the matter.\r\n\r\nOn 9/19/2023, I sent a follow up email with the new records officer, Katie Moxam, requesting the police investigation and supporting documentation.  On 10/13/2023, I received a response from Chief of Police Gregory Gilmore with a 70 page document of Police Department Investigated reports.  While this information is greatly appreciated, I believe it does not satisfy my original request as it does not include the police investigations and supporting documentation for the 4 investigators I originally requested.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that the town has not fulfilled my request entirely and may be withholding these documents from me in my original request.  These investigations are public knowledge as they have been discussed in public meetings that have been documented through meetings minutes and recorded sessions.  Furthermore, it is my understanding that the subject matters in the investigations have either been resolved or closed (e.g. Tappan v. Town of Blackstone et al (4:20-cv-40028) and the separation of former Chief of Police Ross Atstupenas) which would further the argument that they should available for public records request.  I strongly believe that the information should be made available since they were paid for by the residents of Blackstone and in one instance the tax payers paid for an investigation that was indefinitely suspended but the results were never made public or reopened. Please find my the following documentation supporting my original request and the existence of these investigations.\r\n\r\nLinks to meetings and meeting minutes referenced:\r\nBOS Video of Meeting (4/6/2021): https://blackstone.vod.castus.tv/vod/?video=bcd8d818-f428-40e7-af21-1eaf9770fca0&nav=programs%2FSelectmen Video of Meeting\r\nBOS Video of Meeting  (11/10/2020): https://blackstone.vod.castus.tv/vod/?video=99051c09-263a-407f-8bc0-bc5ebc00c699&nav=programs%2FSelectmen Meeting \r\nBOS Meeting Minutes:  https://www.townofblackstone.org/sites/g/files/vyhlif166/f/minutes/bos_mtg_min_04-06-21_1_lm.pdf\r\n\r\n1.\tDuring the 4/6/2021 Board of Selectman Meeting (about 1 hour 47 minutes in) the topic of discussion was a records request from a resident for the full Police Report done in 2019 (by Paul L\u2019Atlien). It was stated that the Summary Report and Full report is on the website, which is untrue, it is just the summary report. In the meeting the town counsel stated that the easiest way to handle this is to send out the full report and maybe in a redacted form. In addition, during the BOS meeting on 11/10/2020, Selectman Keefe held up a copy of the full 600 page report. I am requesting that the full, unredacted report be shared with me and request that since all of the matters have been settled and the issues have been resolved (to my knowledge). \r\n2.\tDuring a previous records request for Board of Selectman Executive Meeting Minutes) the Paul White investigation was mentioned and discussed in Board Of Selectman Executive session meetings on 4/25/17 and 7/24/18. These meeting minutes have been accepted and are now public record. The investigation to my knowledge is closed and the investigation is not available on the website.\r\n3.\tDuring the BOS meeting on 11/10/2020 at about 1 hour and 22 minutes in, Selectwoman Greene mentions a closed investigation performed by Al Donovan. I am unable to find any report on the website or mention of this report that is publicly available.\r\n4.\tAside from the Paul L'Italien investigation, during the 11/10/2020 BOS meeting from about 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 17 minutes in, there is mention of a police investigation that was suspended indefinitely without being completed, \u201cIndefinitely suspending an investigation by private by email, rather than closing it publicly\u201d. Furthermore, it was mentioned that there were several emails between the Town Administrator and the Private Investigator (one being dated 4/22/2019) where the TA negotiated a $1,500 payment but suspended the investigation indefinitely. In the same meeting at 3 hours and 32 minutes in, both Selectwoman Bulso and Selectman Klutchivitz mentioned the \u201cSantin report\u201d.  It is my belief through other research that this was the investigation that was performed by Frank Santin that I requested. As stated in the meeting, this investigation was indefinitely suspended rather than closed publicly. The town also paid $1,500 for a report or partial report that was never completed or made public. For these reasons, I am requesting that this report, any communications between the town and PI, and invoices be made public through my request.  \r\n5.\tIn the same meeting on 11/10/2020, at 3 hour and 28 minutes in, Selectman Keefe presented a stack of paper and binders \u201cfull of Police Investigations\u201d, one being the L'Italien report\r\nand it was 600 pages.  Selectman Keefe stated the investigation cost $16K, which is why I am requesting the invoices paid for these investigations.\r\n6.\tIn the same meeting on 11/10/2020, at 3 hour and 39 minutes in, selectman Keefe mentions a report that Paul L'Italien wrote that focused on the Donovan and Santin report.  I was unable to find any board vote or meeting minutes where this investigation was agreed upon and voted on. For this reason I am requesting this report, as well as the agreed upon scope of all of the reports requested.\r\n\r\nBased on the above supporting documentation, I am requesting that my original request of \u201call full versions of the reports and documentation including procurement processes, scope, and related emails from the TA, town counsel and pertinent boards\u201d from the following investigators: Paul White, Al Donovan, Paul L'Italien, and Frank Santin be fulfilled.  This includes all investigations, emails, scope documentation, and invoices specifically listed in the supporting documentation section (e.g. all investigations performed by Paul L'Italien - the police department, one focusing on the Donovan and Santin reports, etc.) as well any other investigations performed during the time frame specified (2016-Present).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nErik Sorenson",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"911 logs and CAD reports generated in the past two years from the following addresses:\r\n\r\n- 1757 BELMONT AVE, PASADENA, CA 91103-1404 | LOS ANGELES County\r\n\r\n- 11445 MOORPARK ST, NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA 91602-2069 | LOS ANGELES County\r\n\r\n- 76 N FAIR OAKS AVE, PASADENA, CA 91103-3610 | LOS ANGELES County\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to 1757 Belmont Ave. and 76 N. Fair Oaks Ave., the locations provided are not under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department. Therefore, we are unable to respond to your request.\u00a0Please contact the appropriate jurisdiction for further information. You may submit your request to the Pasadena Police Department (https://www.cityofpasadena.net/police/divisions-and-sections/strategic-services/public-records-act/)\u00a0who may have records responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA printout of patrol Calls for Service to 11445 Moorpark Street has been shared with you; please note the time period indicated on the top of the printout. A three-page handout is also attached which will assist you in interpreting the Calls for Service. Calls for Service printouts do not contain information regarding the person who called the police, the name of the person who was the subject of the call, or the telephone number from which the call was made.\u00a0Calls for Service are specific to an address and will generally not specify an apartment or unit number in a multiple-unit apartment complex, duplex or office building. The printout provided to you does not include certified copies of any crime or arrest reports related to a patrol response. Release of these reports, or any information contained therein, is subject to the provisions of the California Government Code, Sections 7920.000 -7930.215 otherwise known as the California Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to 911 logs and CAD reports, in accordance with Sections 7923.600-7923.625 of the California Government Code, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes, are exempt from disclosure. To the extent that records were located, they are either investigatory records themselves or properly part of an investigative file. Therefore, we are denying your request. The requested records may be available in response to a subpoena or court order.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou may personally serve your subpoena to the Custodian of Records at the following location during normal business hours, which are Monday-Friday (excluding City holidays), 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Police Department\r\n\r\nRisk Management and Legal Affairs Division\r\n\r\nPublic Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, SDT Unit\r\n\r\n200 N.

I am a researcher for Insider, a news organization based in New York City, whose mission is journalism in the public interest. This request is for news gathering purposes. I, or my colleagues at Business Insider or Insider, will use the records to inform the public through our reporting. I therefore request a waiver of all fees and charges pursuant to the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. If any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act. If you claim such an exemption to my request under the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act, please cite in writing the specific statutory exemption. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. Please produce these records in the electronic format (such as excel file (.xlsx) or other database form, or as .pdfs) and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHannah Beckler",

        "communication": "City of Los Angeles\r\n\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord request #23-11985 has been closed. The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"911 logs and CAD reports generated at 4115 COLDSTREAM TER, TARZANA, CA 91356-5411, LOS ANGELES County in the past year.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA printout of patrol Calls for Service to the above location has been shared with you; please note the time period indicated on the top of the printout. A three-page handout is also attached which will assist you in interpreting the Calls for Service. Calls for Service printouts do not contain information regarding the person who called the police, the name of the person who was the subject of the call, or the telephone number from which the call was made.\u00a0Calls for Service are specific to an address and will generally not specify an apartment or unit number in a multiple-unit apartment complex, duplex or office building. The printout provided to you does not include certified copies of any crime or arrest reports related to a patrol response. Release of these reports, or any information contained therein, is subject to the provisions of the California Government Code, Sections 7920.000 -7930.215 otherwise known as the California Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to 911 logs and CAD reports, in accordance with Sections 7923.600-7923.625 of the California Government Code, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes, are exempt from disclosure. To the extent that records were located, they are either investigatory records themselves or properly part of an investigative file. Therefore, we are denying your request. The requested records may be available in response to a subpoena or court order.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou may personally serve your subpoena to the Custodian of Records at the following location during normal business hours, which are Monday-Friday (excluding City holidays), 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Police Department\r\n\r\nRisk Management and Legal Affairs Division\r\n\r\nPublic Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, SDT Unit\r\n\r\n200 N. Spring St., Ste. 1900\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, CA 90012\r\n\r\nMain Line: (213) 847-3615\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould any records be located, to the extent the information is recorded, a summary including the time, date, and location of occurrence, the time and date of the call, the name and age of the victim, and a brief statement of the circumstances can be made available to you upon request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

The request # for that is 1495107-000. \r\n\r\nBased on the FBI's FOIA status check site, the agency is still in the process of curating this information. When I visited the site, it states: \"The FBI's FOIPA Program has identified potential responsive information to your request(s) and awaits assignment to a Government Information Specialist (GIS) for further processing.\" \r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm just waiting until that process is complete so that I can access whatever files are cleared for me to view. If its possible to amend the request for a more expeditious delivery, I am fine with restricting the time frame to 2013-2022, to hopefully ensure that all records parsed are digital vs. paper records that need to be sifted through manually. This entity that I'm looking into did not exist before 2013 in any substantive manner. \r\n\r\nPlease advise at your earliest convenience. \r\n\r\nThank you. ",

I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more.

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",
