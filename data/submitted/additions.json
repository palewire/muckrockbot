        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA .csv file containing metadata of all emails sent or received by email address(es) former ICE official Daniel Bible used for official government business during the period beginning January 1, 2024, and continuing through November 6, 2024, containing the domain \"@geogroup.com\" in the To, From, CC, or BCC lines. The .csv file metadata should contain the sender, recipient(s), date sent, time sent, date received, time received, email subject line, attachment name(s), attachment file size(s), priority status, and read receipt status. \r\n\r\nI make this request as a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination, and accordingly, request a fee waiver. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and in support thereof, I make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746: \r\n1. A January 17, 2025, report from the Project on Government Oversight revealed former ICE official Daniel Bible notified ICE Ethics of his intent to transition from employment for ICE to employment for ICE's leading detention contractor, The GEO Group, in November 2024. See https://www.pogo.org/investigations/private-prison-giant-hired-ice-detention-chief. \r\n\r\n2. The end of Mr. Bible's federal employment with ICE, if it occurred, will have been less than one year before the beginning of his planned employment with The GEO Group, if it occurred.\r\n\r\n3. Federal law prohibits certain government officials from working for contractors within one year after they leave federal government under certain circumstances. \r\n\r\n4. GEO previously violated this federal prohibition by hiring former ICE official Tracey Valerio as purported expert in litigation. See: https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-ice-official-paid-to-defend-dollar1-a-day-wages-for-immigrants/. \r\n\r\n5. ICE Ethics imposed no publicly acknowledged penalty against GEO for violating this revolving-door provision. \r\n\r\n6. ICE has unlawfully refused to provide records regarding Ms. Valerio's tenure at ICE for the past six years: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/tracey-valerio-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-72985/#file-1037660. \r\n\r\n7. Similarly, former ICE custody management director and acting ICE director Tae Johnson sought and obtained employment with GEO, which began less than one year after his departure from the agency. https://www.geogroup.com/media/5twe5h5c/4ee9aaae-a38b-4f10-83eb-97c0f8f0c503.pdf. \r\n\r\n8. ICE has unlawfully refused to provide records regarding Mr. Johnson's tenure at ICE for the past 19 months. https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/tae-johnson-death-emails-145670/. \r\n\r\n9. ICE medical officials have repeatedly concluded GEO's failure to comply with the standards set forth in ICE contracts and its own policies have contributed to or caused the deaths in federal custody at or following their detention in GEO facilities. \r\n\r\n10. ICE continues to contract with GEO, and is poised to enter into additional detention contracts with the company worth billions of dollars over the next several years. \r\n\r\n11. The public and policymakers will not have the information to evaluate the efficacy and lawfulness of these contractual arrangements if ICE continues to withhold responsive records for years. \r\n\r\n12. There is an urgent need to inform the public about this actual or alleged government misconduct. \r\n\r\n13. GEO's profitability and increased detention opportunities have been the subject of widespread media attention.
