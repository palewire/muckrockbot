We request a waiver of any fees or costs associated with this request.\r\n\r\nThis request concerns a matter of public interest. The protection of First Amendment rights at public universities, like the University of North Alabama, is of vital concern to the students, faculty, and administrators of that university, and to the greater academic community and the public at large. This request seeks records regarding the University of North Alabama's handling of faculty speech and expressive freedoms.The records are not sought for a commercial or personal interest, but rather for the purpose of providing the public with information concerning civil liberties in higher education.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to charge a fee, please provide a cost estimate for each category of documents requested. Please also provide me with a W9 form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if any specific categories of requested records will require a significantly longer production time than those in other categories, please provide records for each category on a piecemeal basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nRequest for Privilege Log: If any otherwise responsive documents are withheld on the basis that they are privileged or fall within a statutory exemption, please provide a privilege log setting forth (1) the subject matter of the document; (2) the person(s) who sent and received the document; (3) the date the document was created or sent; and (4) the basis on which the document is withheld.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Anne Marie Tamburro.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll records, i.e., reports, correspondence, evidence logs, etc., involving, mentioning, or relating to Dorothy Martin, aka Sister Thedra, aka Marian Keech (May 6, 1900 \u2013 June 13, 1992). Ms. Martin was a noted occultist and UFO devotee, and at various points in her life was the leader of a Chicago-based rapturist cult known as the Seekers, founder of the Association of Sananda and Sumat Kumara, and a member of the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays. In 1954, while leading the Seekers, Ms. Martin predicted the end of the world via a flood; her story was covered in newspapers throughout the United States between October and December of that same year. In accordance with that prediction, Ms. Martin's name and writings appear in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files of a number of other UFO personalities and groups, including George Hunt Williamson, George Adamski, and the Detroit Flying Saucer Club. Page 9 of a bureau report on the Detroit Flying Saucer Club, attached, states an FBI informant furnished the bureau with information on Ms. Martin given to them by a relative who attended a meeting with one of Ms. Martin's followers, Dr. Charles A. Laughead. This report also states on page 1, under a section labeled \"COPIES OF THIS REPORT,\" that information on Ms. Martin was forwarded to the Detroit office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); as such, I am requesting all records produced by AFOSI on Ms. Martin and the Seekers.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Ms. Martin's privacy, as she passed away in 1992. I am attaching a reproduction of Ms. Martin's obituary, published in the Arizona Republic on June 17, 1992.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Although Ms. Martin was a public figure in the UFO community, she had committed no crimes by the nature of her public prophecy in 1954 and subsequent writings in the years after, yet the attached bureau report suggests that she was investigated for so-called subversive activities, a set of actions outlined in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, defined in that act as any \"conspiratorial and coercive tactics\" that \"endeavor to carry out the objectives of the world Communist movement by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by any available means, including force if necessary.\" Page 1 of the attached report indicates it was created as part of an espionage investigation.\r\n\r\nAny records AFOSI may have on Ms. Martin and/or the Seekers would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by showing how the FBI and AFOSI determined which people and groups were thought to be subversive in that period, how they pursued investigations of such figures, and how they did or did not clear those parties of any charges against them, with special concern for religious leaders of non-mainstream faiths and denominations. Ms. Martin, through her association with the Seekers, was a religious leader.\r\n\r\nGiven that this report was created in 1955, almost 70 years have passed since various instruments of the government investigated Ms. Martin and her group. There should be no concern for national security at this point. \r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P043591-091123.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.
