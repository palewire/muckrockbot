        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRelated to the distribution of military equipment to law enforcement agencies under the 1033 Program, as well as any related information on the Homeland Security Grant Program, for the past five years. Specifically, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords of all requests made by law enforcement agencies for surplus military equipment, including the types of equipment requested and the justification for the request.\r\nRecords of all equipment distributed to law enforcement agencies under the 1033 Program and the Homeland Security Grant Program, including the types of equipment distributed, the quantity, and the receiving agencies.\r\nPolicies and procedures governing the distribution of surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies, as well as any relevant guidance or training materials.\r\nRecords of any incidents involving the use of surplus military equipment by law enforcement agencies, including any investigations, disciplinary actions, or reports.\r\nI request that any responsive records be provided to me without redactions or withholdings, except in cases where redactions or withholdings are required by law. Please note that the FOIA requires that any redactions or withholdings be limited to only the specific information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, and that the agency must provide a justification for any such redactions or withholdings.\r\n\r\nI also note that the FOIA requires agencies to provide the requested information in a timely manner. If the requested information is not provided within 20 business days, I reserve the right to pursue all legal remedies available to me.\r\n\r\nTo support my FOIA request, I would like to reference the case law of Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2004), which holds that \u201cgovernmental agencies bear the burden of showing that requested documents are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\u201d I would also like to reference the case law of Martin v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 488 F. Supp. 2d 443, 454 (D.D.C. 2007), which holds that \u201cFOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed, with any doubts resolved in favor of disclosure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
