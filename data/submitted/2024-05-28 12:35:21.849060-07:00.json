The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Jaspal Singh, age 57, who died on April 15, 2024, at the GEO-owned Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between April 15, 2024, and May 28, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Jaspal Singh died in ICE custody on April 15, 2024. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/indian-national-ice-custody-dies-hospital\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Charles Leo Daniel who died March 7, 2024, and before that, in the cases Frankline Okpu and Salvador Vargas, to name just a few.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Singh is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. ICE has engaged a pattern and practice of violating its own policy and Congressional appropriations requirements by failing to post death reports within the 30-day period following detainee deaths.\r\n7. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Folkston facility.\r\n8. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Singh's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Singh's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Folkston facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff. Please provide a quantitative list of the time involved and the staff who performed the tasks.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In particular, PDF has been noticed to obscure bcc and cc recipients, which may be seen as intentional. Please release in .csv as other Colorado organizations have chosen to do.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to a cartoonist and web designer named Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Richards (born October 20th, 1946 - died April 21st, 2023) was a cartoonist in the 1960s and 70s. His work was frequently featured in publications such as The Berkeley Tribe. His death was widely reported, and a news report regarding his passing should be attached, and can be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2023/04/24/ted-richards-rip/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the Cartoonist Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a thorough search for any records on Richards held by the Cincinnati, San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Please note, there appears to have been a previous FOIA request with the bureau for records related to The Berkeley Tribe (FOIA: 1394913-0). Much of that file, which is currently accessible on the Internet Archive, appears to be heavily redacted. Please re-examine The Berkeley Tribe release in relation to the release of documents related to Theodore Richards. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the work that the bureau does, and for the bureau's commitment to transparency. I look forward to the resolution of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

This report must also\r\ninclude any records management corrective actions that CBP will be required to implement as a\r\nresult of the OIG investigation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please include in your report any documentation in the form of policies, training,\r\napproved records schedules or other resources CBP has established to mitigate the records\r\nmanagement risk associated with the improper use of Wickr, WhatsApp, or similar messaging\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nPlease provide your report within 30 days of the date of this letter. I appreciate your attention\r\nto this important matter.

Furthermore, as set forth in Rivero v. Superior Court, 54 Cal. App. 4th 1048 (1997) and Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal, 4th 337 (1993), the investigatory file exemption to the public records act request is not lost even where the investigation is deemed concluded or terminated. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705 \u2013 read in conjunction with Evidence Code \u00a7 1040, provides that official information acquired in confidence by a public employee is exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705 \u2013 read in conjunction with Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the California Constitution provides that personal information details are subject to privacy rights that make such information exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7922.000 \u2013 the records in question are exempt because under the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705 \u2013 read in conjunction with the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\u201d) statutory protections which provides that health care patient confidentiality and medical treatment details are exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705 \u2013 read in conjunction with the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\u201cCACMIA\u201d) statutory protections which provides that health care patient confidentiality and medical treatment details are exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nPursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 129 (CCP129), photos of the deceased are not releasable absent a Court Order. \r\nPlease Note: \r\nRequests for public record information about a decedent (Coroner's Packet) should be made in writing to the Coroner's Office. Send a letter that includes the following: \r\n1. Decedent's name, date of death and Coroner's file number (if known). \r\n2. Include the address where the reports are to be mailed. \r\n3. Include a cashier's check (no personal checks) or money order in the amount of $23 payable to Riverside County Coroner \r\n4. Send your request to: \r\nRiverside County Sheriff-Coroner \r\n800 S Redlands Avenue \r\nPerris, CA 92570 \r\nReports will be mailed as soon as they are ready. Please call their office at 951-443-2300 with any questions. \r\nPlease consider your CPRA request closed. \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCorr.

Your request is granted in part and denied in part. A responsive record is attached.    \u00a0  An agency may interpret the meaning of a request for records, but that interpretation must be reasonable.\u201d Barosh v. Phila. Fire Dep\u2019t, O.O.R. Dkt. AP 2015-2148 (Pa. O.O.R. Oct. 27, 2015); Spatz\r\nv. City of Reading, O.O.R. Dkt. AP 2013-0867, 2013 PA O.O.R.D. Lexis 513. The City has interpreted your request as seeking the Citywide email sent to staff on May 20, 2024 announcing a transition to in-person work starting July 15, 2025. To the extent you intended to seek other records, your request is denied as insufficiently specific. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.\u00a0  \u00a0     Your request does not specify a transaction or activity of the City, but rather seeks all email from more than 25,000 City employees for a period of nearly 1.5 years with broad search terms.\u00a0Among other things, the RTKL requires that a written request\u00a0\u201cidentify or describe the records sought with sufficient\r\nspecificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested\r\n. . . .\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.**\u00a0The requirement of specificity is necessary to (1) ensure that a requestor provides enough information so that \u201can agency can determine whether to grant or deny the request[;]\u201d\u00a0Nanayakkara v. Casella,\r\n681 A.2d 857, 859-60 (Pa. Commw. 1996), and (2) \u201cto prevent agencies from suffering undue interference and obstruction of their daily functions; . . . [which] would be unavoidable if agency officials always could be subjected to broad and unlimited requests for documents and records.\u201d\u00a0Mooney v. Temple Univ. of the Commonwealth Sys. Of Higher Educ. Bd. Of\r\nTrustees, 292 A.2d 395, 397 n.8 (Pa. 1972) (\u201crequests for inspection [must] be specific and particular seeking disclosure of named documents or records rather than broad and unlimited requests for undefined bodies of documents or records\u201d);\u00a0see also, e.g.,\u00a0Arduino v. Borough of Dunmore, 720 A.2d 827, 831 (Pa. Commw. 1998) (holding that a request for \u201c\u2018all records\u2019 related to the disbursement of the funds for [certain] public projects\u201d lacked sufficient specificity),\u00a0appeal denied, 741 A.2d 195 (Pa. 1992);\u00a0Hunt. v. Pa.\r\nDep\u2019t of Corr., 698 A.2d 147, 149 (Pa. Commw. 1997) (holding that requests,\r\nincluding a request for all documents given by Department of Corrections to\r\ninmate and by inmate to Department, lacked sufficient specificity).  \u00a0  Pennsylvania courts have compared such broad, sweeping requests to discovery-type requests which, while potentially proper in the context of civil litigation, are improper under the RTKL. Berman v. Pa. Convention Ctr. Auth., 901 A.2d 1085, 1089 (Pa. Commw. 2006) (holding that request for \u201c\u2018[t]he most recent plans, construction, and design documents\u2019 relating to\u201d the convention center expansion was \u201cmore in the nature of a discovery request than a proper request for public records\u201d); Associated\r\nBuilders and Contractors, Inc. v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Gen Servs., 747 A.2d 962, 965-66 (Pa. Commw. 2000) (holding that requests \u201cakin to document requests under the civil discovery rules, i.e., \u2018any and all documents relating to [subject matter]\u2019\u201d lack sufficient specificity); accord PSP v. OOR, 995\r\nA.2d. 515, 517 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (\u201cThe portion of the request seeking any and\r\nall records, files or communications [concerning subject matter] is\r\ninsufficiently specific for the PSP to respond to the request.\u201d). Such broad\r\nrequests have been, and will be, denied.  \u00a0  It would place an unreasonable burden on the City to go through all of its records for an extended period of time without knowing, with sufficient specificity, what type of records are being sought. Cf. Mollick v. Twp. of Worcester, 32\r\nA.3d 859, 871 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2011) (holding that requests seeking emails\r\nbetween certain agency officials and employees for the past one and five years\r\nwithout sufficiently identifying the subject matter were insufficiently\r\nspecific, and concluding that \u201cit would place an unreasonable burden on an\r\nagency to examine all its emails for an extended time period without knowing,\r\nwith sufficient specificity, what Township business or activity the request is\r\nrelated [to].\u201d) \u200b       This correspondence will close your request with our office as permitted by law.  Respectfully,     Feige\r\nM. Grundman  Pronouns:\r\nshe/her  \u00a0  Chief Deputy City Solicitor  Right to Know Unit  City\r\nof Philadelphia Law Department  One Parkway Building, 17th Floor  1515 Arch Street  Philadelphia, PA 19102   \u00a0  *Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.101 et seq. In accordance with RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires use of the standard statewide Right to Know Form for the submission of written requests pursuant to RTKL (\u201cRTK Requests\u201d). See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file an RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Commw. 2012). This policy is available online at https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/ To the extent you intended to submit an RTK Request, your request is denied as you have not complied with the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a RTK Request pursuant to RTKL and has processed it as an informal\u00a0request. The City nonetheless referred to RTKL for guidance in determining whether records should be released in response to your request.     ** This language is identical to the sufficient specificity requirement in \u00a7 2(c) of the prior Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. 66.1, et seq. Accordingly, the case law interpreting this language in the context of the old Right-to-Know Law remains binding. Dep't of Conservation & Natural Res. v. Office of Open Records, 1 A.3d 929, 940-41 (Pa. Commw. 2010) (interpreting language in the new Act by relying on prior precedent holding that \u201c[t]he language in the two definitions is virtually identical. Faced with a prior judicial interpretation . . . .by . . . the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of the account/voucher/contract language in the RTKL, even though issued in the context of the Old Law, we are not at liberty here to ascribe a different meaning to the same language.\u201d).\u00a0    \r\n                           \r\n                            On\r\n                            Tue, May 21 at  4:08 PM\r\n                            ,  City of Philadelphia Right to Know <righttoknow@phila.gov>  wrote:\r\n                             THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA     Dear 164074-30279347@requests. muckrock. com,     Thank you for your correspondence. This is an automatic response to let you know that the City will process your request and respond further within five business days of its receipt by an Open Records Officer.
