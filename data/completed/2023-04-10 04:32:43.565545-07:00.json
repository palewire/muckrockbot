We have already responded to eighteen of your petitions.\r\n\r\nDue to the volume of petitions and the complexity of the issues raised, we are continuing to invoke the rule of reason and will respond to your petitions within a reasonable time period with the goal of addressing each petition within 30 days of submission. We understand you disagree with this basis. As we recently explained in response to one of your complaints with the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force, we strive to respond to petitions within the 10-day period specified in Section 67.21(d), but we don't view it as an absolute deadline. Particularly here, where the issues raised are novel and you have submitted numerous petitions over a short time period, responding within 10 days is not feasible because doing so would unreasonably impinge on our ability to perform our other responsibilities. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nBradley Russi\r\nDeputy City Attorney\r\nOffice of City Attorney Dennis Herrera\r\nCity Hall, Room 234\r\n1 Dr. Carlton B.

I, Sec. 1) and Administrative Code Section 67.29-5(a), and further find that the Sheriff's Department did not unlawfully withhold or redact records in response to your request.

Your response is required by Feb 11, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).  Emails are requested in the easily-generated EML or MSG formats (SFAC 67.21(l)).\r\n\r\nI am now auditing how the City appears to unlawfully withhold the BCC recipients of emails when they print out emails in certain formats.  The identity of BCC recipients is not exempt.  BCC is not an information security record that reveals vulnerabilities or increases chance of an attack.  The BCC names was typed in by a human being and are not metadata.  You must provide BCC just like you provide To or CC recipients.  There is no legal authority to keep secret the identities of persons communicating with government officials, unless they are specifically confidential informants and such.  If you withhold the BCC names, I will file complaints, separate and apart from email metadata complaints (which I have now already won, see ruling in SOTF 19044).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations: All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27). All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.  \r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\n1. An exact copy with all email headers (incl. but not limited to the BCC identities), attachments, color, formatting, hyperlinks, images, and all other parts of the record of the most recent 5 emails which have any BCC recipients which were sent by your Dept Head on any government account . Note that you will have to search directly from the person's computer or account in their Sent folder specifically (In many email systems, no other method will allow you to see the BCC recipients).  In modern Outlook systems, the search query is as follows: (bcc:*)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses.

The SOTF have started to conduct remote meetings via videoconference and are working to establish procedures to resume all operations including the processing of complaints.\r\nWhile the Sunshine Ordinance requires that certain actions be taken within 45 days, the Covid-19 emergency has forced delays and immense new backlogs for complaint hearings.  We write today to ask if you are willing to waive the 45 day rule for your complaint.\r\nThe SOTF intends to resume hearing complaints on a limited basis and complaints will be queued to be heard in the near future.  We continue to work to address technical issues posed by remote meetings.  We are aware of the time sensitivity of your records requests.  Please be assured that the SOTF appreciates the urgency of your matters and the importance of handling them in a timely manner.\r\n If you have further questions about your files or have other issues, please feel free to email the SOTF Administrator at the email below.\r\nCheryl Leger\r\nAssistant Clerk, Board of Supervisors\r\nCheryl.Leger@sfgov.org<mailto:Cheryl.Leger@sfgov.org>\r\nTel: 415-554-7724\r\nFax: 415-554-5163\r\nwww.sfbos.org\r\n\r\n[CustomerSatisfactionIcon]<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=104>  Click here<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=104> to complete a Board of Supervisors Customer Service Satisfaction form.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Research Center<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=9681> provides 24-hour access to Board of Supervisors legislation, and archived matters since August 1998.\r\n\r\nDisclosures: Personal information that is provided in communications to the Board of Supervisors is subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act and the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance.

        "communication": "Sheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department:\r\n\r\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars.  See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 .  On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \r\n\r\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott.  If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation.\r\n\r\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive).\r\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning.  Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested.  Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office):  https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \r\n\r\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt.  Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified.  You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety.  Please ensure you actually do your duty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time:\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted.   You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence.  They are *his* calendars.   And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part.  First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror.  Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations.  You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt).  You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

We are currently working with other units in our department to gather the records that are responsive to your request, and we will get back to you no later than October 30, 2020. \nOn September 23, 2020, the San Francisco Sheriff's Office\u00a0received your request for records pursuant to the California Public Records Act (CPRA) wherein you requested the following: <sfso.foia@sfgov.org> \nSeptember 23, 2020 \n\nThis is a follow up to request number SOTF 19143: \n\nSheriff Miyamoto and Sheriff's Department: \n\nThis is a new immediate disclosure request. \n\nOn Sept. 2, 2020, in SOTF 19112 Anonymous v. Scott, et al., SOTF found that SFPD violated, inter alia, SFAC 67.26 for not providing future/prospective calendars for Chief Scott at all (instead of providing them with minimal redactions) and SFAC 67.27 for citing Prop G for withholding non-Prop G calendars. See: https://sfgov.org/sunshine/sites/default/files/sotf_090220_minutes.pdf#page=6 . On Sept. 22, the Compliance committee of the SOTF, after learning that SFPD refuses to comply with SOTF's decision, voted to recommend to the full SOTF that \n\nWe are now making a similar request to you, as department head, for your future and non-Prop-G calendars, and if they are not provided with minimal redactions, we will allege willful violation of the Sunshine Ordinance and official misconduct pursuant to SFAC 67.34 by you in light of the SOTF's decision in Anonymous v. Scott. If you wait until the date of meetings have passed to provide them, we will allege the same violation. \n\nYou must provide rolling responses (SFAC 67.25(d)), and thus provide records the business day in which you review them, and not wait until all are ready. \n\nTherefore, this is an immediate disclosure request for all prospective/future calendars/scheduling records (with each Outlook invite or meeting provided as a separate record, not using the daily summary view, and ensuring that you show all meeting details in Outlook, including all subject lines, body messages, attachments, images, attendees, attendance status, invitees, begin and end dates and times, recurrence, and other metadata) for the Sheriff for Nov. 1 through Nov. 15, 2020 as such records exist at the time of this request (dates inclusive). \n\nPursuant to SFAC 67.21(l), wherein you must provide any electronic format I request if it is either available or easily generated: please provide all electronic records in PDF format generated by Outlook's meeting/event details view *without* printing on physical paper and scanning. Rolling responses and exact copies of records are requested. Here is an example of what the format should look like and it can easily be generated by converting the individual Outlook meeting entry into a PDF (provided by the Mayor's Office): https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/01/31/Memo_Style_46.pdf \n\nSFAC 67.26 requires that you provide a record and redact it minimally, unless *every part* of the record is fully exempt. Therefore, you must redact each and every supposedly exempt portion of the individual meeting entries, and cite with a footnote why each redaction is lawfully justified. You are required to actually review the content of each responsive record and ensure that *every word on the page* is exempt, before withholding the record in entirety. Please ensure you actually do your duty. \n\nGiven that I know the City's prior arguments, and the fact that they too were rejected by the SOTF Compliance Committee on Sept. 22, I will preempt them here to save you some time: \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(f): only the \"security procedures\" (such as the security protection detail info for the Sheriff) may be redacted. You can also redact certain details of ongoing law enforcement investigations. But you can't redact the subject matter, body, or attachments in a meeting entry about for example, routine staff matters, political matters, commercial matters, and policy matters. \n\nIf you attempt to use Gov Code 6254(k): you must state which state or federal law prohibits disclosure of each and every part of each and every record. \n\nIf you attempt to use Evid. Code 1040: The Sheriff cannot receive *his own* calendar in confidence. They are *his* calendars. And there is no harm to \"justice\" for the public to know what the Sheriff will be discussing in the future. The only valid use of Evid Code 1040 would be redaction of details regarding for example confidential informant names. \n\nIf you attempt to use Times-Mirror v Superior Court or Gov Code 6255(a): remember that it is the SOTF and courts (not you) that will judge whether or not the Mayor's suspension of SFAC 67.24(g,i) is valid, and if it is, whether the public interest in non-disclosure of a record or any part of a record clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. This is not an equal 50/50 balancing test: you bear the entire evidentiary burden to prove that non-disclosure of *each* part of each record \"clearly outweighs\" the interest in disclosure. \n\nFurthermore, Times-Mirror has two arguments which both rely on 6255(a) - a safety of the Governor part and a deliberative process part. First, you are not the Governor, and Article 1, Section 3 of the California Constitution requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, including those created by prior court cases like Times-Mirror. Furthermore, the deliberative process privilege ban of SFAC 67.24(h) has been explicitly preserved by the Mayor's emergency proclamations. You cannot use any of these exemptions to withhold the subject matter and attendee names of meetings - as that is a deliberative process matter, and not a safety matter. \n\nFor example, in SOTF 19103 Anonymous v. Breed re: the Mayor's future calendar, Mayoral Compliance Officer Heckel, while using Times-Mirror and GC 6254(f) as a defense, states \"topics that were going to be discussed or something without any reference to date or times or places\" may be provided - at the very least, we will expect your agency to provide that (though we do not concede that everything else is exempt). You may examine the hearing at: https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=98&clip_id=34616 \n\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose. \n\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure. \n\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX.

(The other five were Edwin Edwards, George Wallace, Jim Hunt, Bill Janklow, and Terry Branstad.) Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. As governor in 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio's mayor, after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists on May 2. On May 4, four students were killed and nine others were wounded by the Guard. One victim, Dean Kahler, suffered permanent paralysis. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not required, as the subject was born over 100 years ago.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Carter's family shared video footage of a trail camera showing Rasheem on a wooded trail near Taylorsville indicating that there is video footage. \r\n- Any emails to, from, and cc'ing Smith County Sheriff's Department head Charlie Crumpton that includes the keywords \"Rasheem Carter\" \"Carter\" \"Rasheem\" \r\n- Any emails to, from, and cc'ing Taylorsville Police Chief Gabe Horn that includes the keywords \"Rasheem Carter\" \"Carter\" \"Rasheem\" \r\n\r\nHuffPost reported that Smith County Sheriff's Department is overseeing the criminal investigation into Rasheem's death. Taylorsville Police Chief Gabe Horn told a local newspaper in December that Rasheem Carter filed a police report when he visited the station but declined to press any charges against whomever was threatening him. Police found Rasheem's body on November 2, 2022. https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2022/12/07/family-seeking-answers-in-fayette-mans-death/\r\n\r\nLocal media reported that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation stepped in to assist in the investigation into Rasheem Carter's death. https://www.wlbt.com/2023/03/22/mbi-asking-publics-help-rasheem-carter-death-investigation/ \r\n\r\nI'm a senior reporter for the Guardian, and the family has been outspoken about this case. The case is a matter of public interest given that the case has been unresolved at the moment, without a suspect in custody, and the case is under investigation. That said, I would request a rolling release of materials if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdwin Rios",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

The following constraints limit this FOIA request:\r\n\r\n3.1. Only specific agency documents are requested for each IED/EFP attack, including:\r\n3.1.1. Combined Information Data Network Exchange (\"CIDNE\") Significant Activity (\"SIGACT\") report(s);\r\n3.1.2. CIDNE Improvised Explosive Device (\"IED\") report(s);\r\n3.1.3. Medical Evacuation (\"MEDEVAC\") Nine\u2013Line transcript(s);\r\n3.1.4. MEDEVAC Assault Support Request(s) (\"ASR\");\r\n3.1.5. Composite Timeline report(s);\r\n3.1.6. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (\"EOD\")/Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell (\"CEXC\") storyboard report(s);\r\n3.1.7. Serious Incident Report(s) (\"SIR\");\r\n3.1.8. Weapons Intelligence Team (\"WIT\") report(s);\r\n3.1.9. Intelligence Directorate (\"C2\") Operations Watch Highlights report(s);\r\n3.1.10. IED Post Patrol Debrief (\u201c64\u2013Liner\u201d) report(s);\r\n3.1.11. Battle Damage Assessment (\u201cBDA\u201d) reports(s);\r\n3.1.12. Multi National Division (\"MND\")/Multi National Corps\u2013Iraq (\"MNC\u2013I\") IED/EFP Update report(s);\r\n3.1.13. Multi National Force\u2013Iraq (\"MNF\u2013I\") Battle Update Assessment(s) (\"BUA\") briefing slides;\r\n3.1.14. AR 15\u20136 Investigation report(s) and/or Command Directed Investigation (\u201cCDI\u201d) report(s);\r\n3.1.15. Hospital casualty update report(s);\r\n3.1.16. Defense Casualty Information Processing System\u2013Forward (\"DCIPS\u2013CF\") report(s).\r\n\r\n3.2. Excluding any documents containing the agency\u2019s deliberative material or recommendations;\r\n3.3. Excluding any documents classified Top Secret (\u201cTS\u201d), Sensitive Compartmented Information (\u201cSCI\u201d), and/or Special Access Program (\u201cSAP\u201d); however,\r\n3.4. Including all of the agency\u2019s responsive documents that are classified below the TS, SCI and/or SAP levels; for example, any documents marked Unclassified (\u201cU\u201d), Sensitive But Unclassified (\u201cSBU\u201d), For Official Use Only (\u201cFOUO\u201d), Confidential (\u201cC\u201d), Law Enforcement Sensitive (\u201cLES\u201d), and/or Secret (\u201cS\u201d).\r\n\r\n4. Although FOIA has always presumed that government records are open to public inspection, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-185, prohibits agencies from withholding records unless (1) \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law\u201d or (2) \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by\u201d one of FOIA\u2019s exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A). Thus, in addition to FOIA favoring disclosure and requiring its exemptions to be narrowly construed, Section 552(a)(8)(A) prohibits agencies from using their discretion to broadly withhold records merely because they believe an exemption could technically apply.\r\n\r\n5. In order to expedite the agency\u2019s release of the requested documents, please disclose them on an interim, rolling basis as they become available; for example, without waiting for all of the agency\u2019s relevant systems of record to be searched, or all of its relevant records to be processed. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\n6. If the agency\u2019s processing costs for this request exceed $350.00, please notify me in advance so that I might consider paying any additional fees for a complete and accurate set of responsive documents. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n7. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Scantling",

A delay was incurred because of our current Command posture regarding COVID\u201019.  On 31 January 2020, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the nation\u2019s healthcare community in responding to COVID-19.  On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization publicly characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.    Then on 17 March 2020, Office of Management and Budget offered more stringent guidance stating, \u201c[i]n order to achieve this posture [social distancing], consistent with The President's Coronavirus Guidelines for America, the Government must immediately adjust operations and services to minimize face-to-face interactions\u2026.\u201d  .  USCENTCOM has implemented these guidelines to protect its employees and their communities, and to ensure that it can continue to protect the United States during this national emergency.  Specifically, USCENTCOM leadership issued guidance requiring any employees who can telework must do so.  Telework is not available for FOIA employees, therefore the processing of your FOIA request may be delayed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFOIA 17-0547 is currently #129 in the USCENTCOM FOIA queue.  In the meanwhile, you may track all your open requests on the queue report on our website at: https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/statusreport/foia_status_report.pdf.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMr. Steven Johnson\r\n\r\nUSCENTCOM FOIA Requester Service Center\r\n\r\n(813) 529-6285",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

        "communication": "Rebecca Williams,\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore City Department of Finance (\u201cDOF\u201d) is in receipt of your records request below. This request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), codified in Sections 4-101 et seq. of the General Provisions Article of the Maryland Code. A request for public information under the PIA must be submitted to the custodian of public records. Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-202(a). Each governmental entity is the custodian of its own records. See Baltimore City Code, Art. 1 \u00a7 10-1. This response is on behalf of DOF.\r\n\r\nThe search for the documents you have requested and their review may take more than 10-days due to the volume of documentation you requested and the fact that many City personnel are teleworking with limited access to hard copies of responsive files. Once the documents are gathered, we will then know the volume of the responsive documentation.  The PIA allows the government to charge for any time past two hours that it takes to gather, review and redact, if necessary, any documents requested at the rate of the employee performing the work after giving the first two hours labor for free.  Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-206; accord Md. Public Information Act Compliance Board Opinion 16-05. If there are a substantial number of documents to review that will take us more than two hours, we will let you know of the cost and where to send payment, which is required before any documents will be reviewed.

This request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), codified in Sections 4-101 et seq. of the General Provisions Article of the Maryland Code. A request for public information under the PIA must be submitted to the custodian of public records. Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-202(a). Each governmental entity is the custodian of its own records. See Baltimore City Code, Art. 1 \u00a7 10-1.\r\nThis response is on behalf of DOF and the responsive documents are attached. Confidential commercial or financial information has been selectively redacted from this production, which includes any materials that were provided on the assurance of confidentiality, or that would cause substantial harm to ABB\u2019s and/or Itron\u2019s position if disclosed to the public. See, e.g., Amster v. Baker, 453 Md. 68,81 (2017); see also Food Marketing Institute v. Argus, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 2366 (2019). This includes redacting the names and contact information of key employees. See, e.g., Audio Technical Services Ltd v. Department of the Army, 487 F. Supp. 779, 782 (D.D.C. 1980).\r\nNothing in this response is intended to indicate that any records sought from City agencies exist or to waive any privileges held by the Mayor and City Council.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Are there any more specific terms you would like to provide regarding specific complaints or individuals for whom you are looking for records?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with your request as written, please let me know and I will update the expected timeline for processing the request.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Could you please provide me with some additional information about the definitions of these variables? In particular, does start_date mean the date that someone first started working for the state, so it should theoretically never change even if the employee leaves and then comes back? \r\n\r\nThank you for all of your time and assistance -- I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBen",
