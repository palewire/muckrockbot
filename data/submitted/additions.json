        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a grant and/or contract awarded by the United States Department of State to the Global Internet Freedom Consortium (GIFC) in 2010. Please see the following link from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC): http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm\r\n\r\nThe lede in the above BBC article states: \"A Falun Gong-linked group that promotes internet freedom says the US state department has offered it $1.5m, in a move condemned by Chinese officials.\"\r\n\r\nThe GIFC, as noted, is linked to practitioners of Falun Gong, a new religious movement originating from China. Falun Gong members have created and currently run non-profit organizations, media companies, and human rights groups, all of which focus on censorship and human rights abuses in China, and because of this, the group and its associated entities have received public and financial support from the United States government.\r\n\r\nYet, in 2021, news organizations such as National Public Radio (NPR) reported on disputes within the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) over a contract (award ID: 95170021K0011) awarded to Ultrareach Internet Corp. (UEI: P9R8NZXL3SH3), a member of the GIFC, in 2020. Please see the following link from NPR: https://www.npr.org/2021/04/14/986982387/falun-gong-steve-bannon-and-the-trump-era-battle-over-internet-freedom\r\n\r\nIn the above NPR article, Matthew Baise, director of digital strategy and audience development for Voice of America, a child organization of the USAGM, was quoted from an internal audit as stating the following of Ultrasurf, software developed by Ultrareach Internet Corp. and promoted by the GIFC: \"We spent nearly two weeks checking and double-checking how the number could possibly be this low. We believe the true, final number of measurable traffic from Ultrasurf to be so miniscule because a) none of the networks were ever notified of its existence so it was never promoted b) it's only available for Windows desktop machines (almost all our audience is on mobile devices) and c) it is a brand new product. In the absence of promotion on Ultrasurf's end, this thing was essentially invisible.\"\r\n\r\nGiven public reporting on the dispute over contract ID 95170021K0011 and the apparent failure of Ultrasurf to meet the parameters of that contact, any other financial support, whether through grants or contracted work, awarded to the GIFC and its member organizations can reasonably be understood as being of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (traditional mail, faxes, email, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Global Internet Freedom Consortium\r\n\r\nI am asking you to waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Reasons for public interest have been noted above.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
