The Lia radiological incident occurred in the country of Georgia in late 2001 and early 2002. The accident was the result of improperly stored and abandoned Soviet-era radioisotope thermoelectric generators. This accident resulted in the injuries to three Georgian villagers. The accident happened just months after 9/11 and the government of Georgia openly asked for international assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (the IAEA) in locating the material. \r\n\r\nThis incident is likely to have generated considerable national security correspondence. Georgia's government was an ally of the United States. The United States is a member of the IAEA, and the Georgian government requesed help from the IAEA. Issues related to errant nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union were a prerogative of the United States as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program created by the Nunn-Lugar act. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, threats related to \"dirty bomb\" attacks were routinely reported on in nightly newscasts and in the newspapers. \r\n\r\nMore information about the Lia incident can be found in this report published by the IAEA:\r\n\r\nhttps://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1660web-81061875.pdf\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for information, analyses, summaries, assessments, transcripts, audio or visual recordings, or similar records related to the Lia, Georgia incident. Limit the search to documents related to the Lia incident created from December 2nd 2001 to December 2nd 2005. An additional interest would be if the Lia incident and the aftermath was discussed in relation to the beginning of the Saakashvili administration some years later. \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency and I look forward to working together until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Any search terms or queries used for searching social media or news reports as a result of the \"Catch and Revoke\" effort reported by Axios on March 6, 2025 (https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/state-department-ai-revoke-foreign-student-visas-hamas) and on March 27, 2025 (https://www.axios.com/2025/03/27/trump-palestinian-hamas-purge-colleges-protests).\r\n\r\n2. Any policies, manuals, or training materials concerning the intent or use of the \"Catch and Revoke\" effort.\r\n\r\n3. Any contract or agreement with any entity concerning any services, software, or platforms used for the purpose of the \"Catch and Revoke\" effort.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.12(d)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's involvement in the revocation of visas or green cards due to protest activity or expression protected by the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles and statements demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include:\r\n\r\na. https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/state-department-ai-revoke-foreign-student-visas-hamas\r\nb. https://www.axios.com/2025/03/27/trump-palestinian-hamas-purge-colleges-protests\r\nc. https://www.justsecurity.org/109069/u-s-ai-driven-catch-and-revoke-initiative-threatens-first-amendment-rights/\r\nd. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/3346812/trump-administration-ai-revoke-visas-pro-hamas-students/\r\ne. https://www.ibtimes.com/us-uses-ai-ban-student-visas-over-hamas-supportheres-what-you-need-know-3766019\r\nf. https://www.wkrn.com/news/national/state-department-using-ai-to-ban-visas-over-perceived-pro-hamas-posts/amp/\r\ng. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14471541/marco-rubio-canceling-visas-foreigners-hamas-support.html\r\nh. https://m.economictimes.com/nri/latest-updates/trump-administration-to-use-ai-in-an-effort-to-catch-and-revoke-student-visas-over-alleged-hamas-support/articleshow/118778056.cms\r\ni. https://gizmodo.com/state-department-will-use-ai-to-search-for-pro-hamas-students-to-deport-2000573143\r\nj. https://www.nysun.com/article/state-department-begins-canceling-visas-of-pro-terror-students-plans-to-use-ai-to-identify-visa-holding-hamas-sympathizers\r\nk. https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/us-deploys-ai-to-revoke-visas-of-foreign-nationals-supporting-hamas-report-19570130.htm\r\nl. https://www.jta.org/2025/03/07/united-states/trump-administration-reportedly-to-use-ai-to-find-hamas-supporting-foreign-students-to-deport\r\nm. https://townhall.com/tipsheet/rebeccadowns/2025/03/06/its-happening-state-department-revoking-visas-of-pro-hamas-agitators-here-on-student-visas-n2653416\r\nn. https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/us-news/state-department-to-deploy-ai-powered-catch-and-revoke-tools-against-hamas-sympathizers-report/\r\no. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/foreign-student-visas-pro-palestinian-ai\r\np. https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-use-ai-revoke-visas-students-perceived-hamas-supporters-axios-reports-2025-03-06/\r\nq. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-department-revokes-first-visa-foreign-student-linked-hamas-supporting-disruptions\r\nr. https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2025/03/10/yes-of-course-we-should-revoke-student-visas-from-hamas-supporters-n2653506\r\ns. https://radio.foxnews.com/2025/03/10/state-department-to-use-ai-to-send-foreign-pro-hamas-students-packing/\r\nt. https://www.dailywire.com/news/trumps-ice-detains-anti-israel-activist-who-led-campus-protests-at-columbia\r\nu. https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-07/ty-article/u-s-to-reportedly-use-ai-to-revoke-visas-of-students-it-sees-as-hamas-supporters/00000195-6e84-d0f8-a1f7-7ec70da10000\r\nv. https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trumps-student-visa-crackdown-free-speech\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.16(j), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Any records concerning the revocation of a visa or green card with respect to Rumeysa Ozturk who was arrested on or about March 25, 2025.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications with the White House concerning Rumeysa Ozturk.\r\n\r\n3. Any communications with the Department of Homeland Security concerning Rumeysa Ozturk on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.12(d)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's involvement in the revocation of a visa or green card due to protest activity or expression protected by the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles and statements demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include:\r\n\r\na. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html\r\nb. https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tufts-graduate-student-detained-by-federal-immigration-authorities-42d57a0a\r\nc. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14540283/turkish-student-hijab-filmed-detained-ice-ramadan-tufts-university.html\r\nd. https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/looked-like-a-kidnapping-uni-student-taken-by-masked-agents-in-trump-crackdown-20250327-p5lmy9.html\r\ne. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student\r\nf. https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tufts-student-detained-masked-federal-agents-1235304299/\r\ng. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/its-really-scary-students-residents-react-sudden-arrest-tufts-student/\r\nh. https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2025/03/26/tufts-rumeysa-ozturk-detained\r\ni. https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/us/video/tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk-ice-digvid\r\nj. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/26/federal-agents-detain-tufts-university-student-turkey/82674919007/\r\nk. https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/international-student-tufts-university-reportedly-taken-into-federal-custody/2VK55QMAOZFIDBR2A6XNKC5XOU/\r\nl. https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/03/26/ag-campbell-says-shes-monitoring-situation-after-tufts-grad-student-arrested-by-ice/\r\nm. https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/26/metro/tufts-student-detailed-by-immigration-officials/\r\nn. https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010075008/tufts-student-ice-arrest.html?playlistId=video/latest-video\r\no. https://www.jns.org/common-sense-arrest-of-pro-hamas-protester-rumeysa-ozturk-says-homeland-security/\r\np. https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/03/26/tufts-graduate-student-whos-pro-palestinian-detained-by-federal-authorities-in-somerville/\r\nq. https://www.rawstory.com/watch-stunning-video-shows-turkish-tufts-grad-student-cuffed-by-homeland-security/\r\nr. https://forward.com/fast-forward/707596/tufts-international-grad-student-detained-by-ice-in-latest-action-targeting-pro-palestinian-activist/\r\ns. https://www.mediaite.com/news/disturbing-video-shows-masked-men-hauling-away-pro-palestine-student-her-whereabouts-are-unknown/\r\nt. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rumeysa-ozturk-canary-mission-tuft-university_n_67e44604e4b00db00a39340e\r\nu. https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370602253112\r\nv. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tufts-says-international-student-taken-into-us-custody-visa-revoked-2025-03-26/\r\nw. https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/us-news/tufts-says-international-student-taken-into-us-custody-visa-revoked/\r\nx. https://pressley.house.gov/2025/03/26/rep-pressleys-statement-on-arrest-of-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk/\r\ny. https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/video-shows-arrest-of-tufts-university-graduate-student-235439685766\r\nz. https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-ma-condemns-ice-abduction-of-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk/\r\naa. https://www.seattletimes.com/news/turkish-student-at-tufts-university-detained-video-shows-masked-people-handcuffing-her/\r\nbb. https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-03-26/turkish-student-at-tufts-university-detained-video-shows-masked-people-handcuffing-her\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.16(j), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

These might include the following artifacts:\r\n\r\n1. Formal compliance documentation like Authorizations to Operate (ATOs) or System Security Plans (SSPs) or \"baselines\" that outline the appropriate FISMA level for DOGE systems that collect data (Low/Moderate/High), what NIST controls they must demonstrate meeting and documentation of evidence they have met those NIST controls.\r\n2. Guidance/internal documentation to DOGE staff about properly securing data both in transit and at rest. Considering that many of the DOGE staff are both new to federal employment and working with data from multiple agencies, does this include any mandatory training or signed rules of behavior, etc.\r\n3. Any information on system configuration or automated tools that are used to ensure these rigorous data standards are being met on USDS equipment.\r\n4. Any MOUs or agreements for transferring data between agencies and USDS that include more detailed requirements on how they should meet the requirements of this mandate.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
