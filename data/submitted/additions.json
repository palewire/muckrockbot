        "communication": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is a Texas Public Information Act request for records regarding the unclaimed property funds. Specifically, I'm requesting records/a procedure manual? on how the records are loaded into your system and records on how you redact out the address_line_1 in this database. I am also asking for any reports on the number of social security numbers found in the field/column address_line_1. \r\n\r\nMy understanding is this is redacted out via a software program that is checking for sensitive information such as social security numbers. The reason I'm asking for this information is to see if there is any human review over this data redaction. \r\n\r\nI was reviewing the January unclaimed property database and there were 26,164,756 unique property IDs. 3,144,883 had redacted addresses. 12% of the addresses in the unclaimed property database were redacted. \r\n\r\nThis database represents billions of dollars of unclaimed funds to the public. If 10% of the addresses are being redacted unnecessarily (and could potentially be fixed with a small process change) I believe this represents a barrier in individuals finding and claiming unclaimed funds and is reducing the amount of funds claimed by the public. As such, I believe this request is in the public interest and am requesting a fee waiver. \r\n\r\nSince I believe this request to be in the public interest, please note I am requesting this via Muckrock and the records will be publicly available. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nJohn Ricker",
