        "communication": "I am merging some of the language into this request from a request that I am withdrawing due to insufficient specificity, request 60889.\r\n\r\nMy limited understanding of the workings of NIAID records management is that it appears that I cannot query for communications from outside sources without specifying an NIAID \"custodian\". This is disappointing, but not something I can change. For reference, the following language is from withdrawn request 60889:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Emails to or from drtedros@who.int, or any other communications to or from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the WHO. Similarly for the following email addresses and individuals:\r\n\r\nvankerkhovem@who.int, Maria Van Kerkhove of\r\ngreint@who.int (Dr Thomas Grein)\r\nryanm@who.int (Mike Ryan)\r\nJeremy Farrar - chief scientist at the World Health Organization, may not be using who.int email address in official capacity\r\nsterng@who.int (Gabriellea Stern)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, broadly, any individuals and email addresses associated with the who.int top level domain.\"\r\n\r\n ---\r\n\r\nI would like to amend this current request (60900) with the following language to prebut certain redactions:\r\n\r\nIn the government's response to several other FOIA requests, hundreds and hundreds of pages of responsive records originating from the WHO were redacted under exemption (b)(5).\r\n\r\nFor example, an attachment in one such request titled \"WHO Confidential Situation Report, Saturday, 13 June 2020\", in an email from moffettd@who.int, sent on Saturday, June 13, 2020 4:24 AM.\r\n\r\nCountless other examples abound in the responsive records for other requests. GORAN call notes. Slide decks. Various reports and drafts of reports.\r\n\r\nIn Lucaj v. FBI, No. 16-1381 (6th Cir. 2017), The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled:\r\n\"Key to answering this question is the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be \u2018inter-agency or intra-agency.\u2019\u201d Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. Indeed, the first condition here is all-important. However broad the term agency can be, see Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, Bureaucracy at the Boundary, 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 841 (2014), FOIA offers, for our purposes, a more limited definition: \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), cited in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (elaborating that \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency\u201d). So, to be inter-agency memorandums or letters, the RFAs must have been sent from an authority of the Government of the United States to an authority of the Government of the United States. The OIA, undoubtedly an authority of the Government of the United States, sent the RFAs to the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed country, undoubtedly not authorities of the Government of the United States. The RFAs\u2019 recipients having failed to meet\r\nFOIA\u2019s definition of agency, we hold that the RFAs from the OIA to the Central Authority of Austria and the unnamed country are not inter-agency. And given that the RFAs are not intra-agency either, they may not be withheld under Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n...and later in the ruling:\r\n\"But in the end, Congress chose to limit the exemption\u2019s reach to \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), not to \u201cmemorandums or letters among agencies, independent contractors, and entities that share a common interest with agencies.\u201d In view of our responsibility to \u201cnarrowly construe[]\u201d FOIA\u2019s exemptions, see Schell, 843 F.2d at 937 (quoting Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)), our response today echoes that of the Supreme Court and Congress: however important it may be for the OIA to have frank communications with the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government, however common the interest between the OIA and its international partners, the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government are not, so far as Congress has defined the term, agencies. Therefore, the RFAs from the OIA to these countries are not \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters\u201d within the scope of Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this, all responsive communications to and from agencies of *foreign* governments must be released under the law, they may not be redacted or withheld under (b)(5). According to the court opinion, this applies no matter if they're deliberative, predecisional, or redactable under any (b)(5) privilege. If the NIH FOIA officers cannot provide a superseding court decision, they will be in violation of law. I am willing at this point to retain legal counsel.\r\n\r\nThis should include all manner of foreign documents previously incorrectly redacted or withheld under (b)(5), including but absolutely not limited to GORAN call notes, slide decks, various reports and drafts of reports, emails that were sent to many other recipients in addition to being to or from the NIH, and anything similar.\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, several responsive records in the aforementioned FOIA request (and other, similar, requests) appear to have been withheld entirely under (b)(4). GORAN call notes are one such record.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act explains of exemption 4:\r\n\r\n\"The exemption also affords protection to those submitters who are required to furnish commercial or financial information to the government by safeguarding them from the competitive disadvantages that could result from disclosure.4 The exemption covers two distinct categories of information in federal agency records, (1) trade secrets, and (2) information that is (a) commercial or financial, and (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential\"\r\n\r\n(And)\r\n\r\n\"The D.C. Circuit's decision in Public Citizen represented a distinct departure from what until then had been almost universally accepted by the courts -- that a \"trade secret\" encompasses virtually any information that provides a competitive advantage. In Public Citizen, a \"trade secret\" was more narrowly defined as \"a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort.\"8 This definition also incorporates a requirement that there be a \"direct relationship\" between the trade secret and the productive process.9\"\r\n\r\nI find it highly questionable that the GOARN call notes - about an ongoing disease outbreak - contain entirely \"commercial or financial\" text. I also find it wildly unlikely that the GOARN calls were only ever about the implementation of specific manufacturing techniques.",

Duplicates from each year do not need to be completed. At a minimum, photos for 2023 - 2024 should be included. \r\n\r\nPrecedent: Santa Ana Police Department and LAPD have released their photos. A reminder that nothing in California Penal Code 832.7 mentions photographs in personnel records are kept confidential. Not only that, but videos and pictures of officers are regularly shared on social media. \r\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-las-second-lawsuit-against-journalist-over-police-headshots/\r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-13/city-of-la-officers-city\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

I am specifically requesting the audio recording material and not the transcripts or other summarized format of these recordings. This includes announcements made when the doors close - i.e. \"The doors are closing, please stand clear of the doors\" - and older or retired variants of the audio recording materials that are not presently in use.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeffrey Adams",

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations) \r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.\u00a0 Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\u00a0 Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). As the subject matter of your request is of substantial interest to two or more components of CBP or of substantial interest to another agency, we will need to consult with those entities before we issue a final response.\u00a0 Due to these unusual circumstances, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.\u00a0 We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \n\n\u2022\tApproximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety. \n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \n\u2022\tOther: Please be advisee that there are NO RECORDS for expenses regarding the production of the materials \n\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-2021-004391 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon, \r\n\r\nWe received your response to our request yesterday. Thank you very much for providing it. We appeal the following aspects of this response: \r\n\r\n1. We appeal the adequacy of CRCL's search. \r\nThe agency provided a 10-page document with several withholdings, and noted that an additional 66 pages were referred to ICE (63) and OIG (3). However, the records CRCL supplied demonstrate additional responsive records exist that an adequate search would have turned up, and that those records were not provided. First, there is a word document entitled \"Complaint 005843-23-ICE Short Form.docx attached to the August 1, 2023 email at page 8 of the response that appears to be a CRCL document that is excluded from the agency's response. Second, there are two attachments to the August 3, 2023 email that appear to be CRCL documents and are not included. Third, there are appears to be an attachment to the October 13, 2023, email entitled \"2023.08.29-[b6].pdf\" that is not included in the production. Fourth, the October 13 email contains an apparent link to \"Civil Liberties Collaboration Tool - 23-CRCL-4775 Dumitrascu, Cristian (SND) - All Documents (sharepoint.com). None of the CRCL documents from this Sharepoint drive, and no screenshots of the folder, appear in the CRCL production. For these reasons, CRCL's search appears to have overlooked obvious leads and the agency appears to have failed to undertake an iterative review of responsive materials in the initial production for potential additional responsive records. Our request sought [a]ny reports, investigative records, correspondence, taskings, notifications, or expert reviews by CRCL experts\" in response to Mr. Dumitrascu's death. It does not appear from this 10-page document that the agency is provided all responsive records. \r\n\r\n2. We appeal the application of Exemption 5. \r\nGiven the context of the released material, it is clear that exemption 5 does not apply to all of the redacted  portions because these are not interagency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. Communications between a non-CRCL subject matter expert contractor (2024-CRFO-00207-000010) do not qualify for protection under Exemption 5 because they are not inter- or intra-agency communications within the definition of the contractor corollary as adopted by FOIA courts. The SME is independent, and thus, they are not being asked to perform a duty of a CRCL employee, but an outside contractor's function. Indeed--it is the SME consultant's independent and unbiased position separate and apart from the government structural that CRCL valued when it contracted with them. \r\n\r\nAs to remaining exemption 5 applications, the materials redacted are not pre-decisional. Rather, they reflect the implementation of a decision already taken, i.e., to conduct a CRCL review of the death of Mr. Dumitrascu. \r\n\r\n3. We appeal the agency's application of Exemption 6. \r\nAs to Exemption 6, the records CRCL do not meet the threshold for invoking the exemption. They are not medical files. They are not personnel files. And they are not similar to medical or personnel files. They are emails. Consequently, the Exemption 6 threshold is not met. Even if it were, however, we appeal the application of Exemption 6 to email domain names, which are block-redacted in the agency's production. \r\n\r\n4. We appeal the agency's failure to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt material.\r\nAs an initial matter, it appears from the first three pages of CRCL's response that the agency failed to release all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the pages the agency withheld in full (WIF) under exemptions 5 and 6. Even assuming exemption 5 could cover some of the information on this WIF pages, it cannot be applied to withhold factual information regarding Mr. Dumitrascu's death. See Transgender Law Center v. ICE, 46 F.3d 771, 785 (9th Cir. 2021).\r\n\r\n5. We appeal the agency's redactions in full because CRCL made no foreseeable harm determination.\r\nWe appeal the application of Exemptions 5 and 6 because the agency has not asserted that any foreseeable harm will come from releasing any of the otherwise exempt material. Congress amended FOIA in 2016 to add the foreseeable harm standard, and require release of material that would be withheld unless an official within the agency determines such release would cause foreseeable harm. No such determination is possible on the basis of the records released. Indeed, it is the government's secrecy with respect to oversight about deaths in ICE custody that causes harm--not transparency about that process. \r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, we appeal CRCL's May 28 FOIA response and request that the 10 pages be released in full, the unprovided attachments be provided, the Sharepoint drive be released to the extent it contains CRCL records, and all other responsive records that would be located through an iterative, adequate search be released. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your timely acknowledgement and response to this appeal. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Villanueva, RAO, Massasoit Community College\r\n\r\nDear AJ Vincelli,\r\n\r\nI am writing to confirm receipt of your request and to initiate a response within ten (10) business days.\r\n\r\nIt is the College\u2019s intent to supply you with a fee estimate for this request. But before we provide the formal fee estimate, we wanted to inform you of the scope and scale of the work the College must conduct to produce these materials.\r\n\r\nThe College does not have an existing report that includes all of the information you are requesting. The College\u2019s Comptroller would therefore need to manually compile disparate reports to produce this information, all while reviewing the information closely to make any redactions needed. This time-intensive process would require at least four to six weeks (and at least 150 hours). At the $25/hour rate set by the Commonwealth\u2019s Public Records Law, we would anticipate a fee estimate of at least $3,750.\r\n\r\nPer your request, we invite you to modify your request as necessary. But please understand that there will likely still be a significant amount of \u201chuman time\u201d to review for redactions and may still necessitate a (albeit reduced) fee.\r\n\r\nUpon your response to this email or a revision of the request, we will issue the formal fee estimate for your review.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlex J.

It should noted that case sensitive searches are not possible, so the term \"Anonymous\" returns both references to the group \"Anonymous\" as well as any reference to anonymous tips, informants, etc. As we can't segregate between the two meanings of the word, USMS would have to manually review every single document just to identify the possibly responsive files. To that end, USMS would like to request that you narrow the scope of the request so that we can continue to process your request. One suggestion would be to remove the term \"Anonymous\" from the search terms and just proceed with variations of \"hack\" (which would include variations of hacker, hacktivist, hacktivism), but we are open to suggestions. \n\nYour request in currently being placed in a pending yourresponse.

This request specifically emphasizes activities related to Defense Distributed and thegatalog.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, I am seeking the following detailed records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInternal Memos and Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny internal memos, emails, or communications discussing the identification, tracking, or handling of ghost guns within the NYPD during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence related to Defense Distributed and their impact on the proliferation of ghost guns.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunication regarding any collaborations or information sharing with federal agencies, such as the ATF or FBI, on ghost gun-related matters.\r\n\t2.\tInvestigative Reports and Cases:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll documents related to investigations or cases conducted by the NYPD involving ghost guns from January 1, 2019, through the date this request is processed.\r\n\t\u2022\tSpecifically, information on cases associated with Defense Distributed and any links to thegatalog.\r\n\t\u2022\tReports detailing the outcomes of investigations, including arrests made, charges filed, and any convictions related to ghost gun activities.\r\n\t3.\tPolicies and Guidelines:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of policies, guidelines, or procedures implemented by the NYPD in response to the increased prevalence of ghost guns during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny directives related to Defense Distributed and efforts to address the challenges posed by ghost guns.\r\n\t\u2022\tInformation on the training provided to law enforcement officers regarding the identification and handling of ghost guns.\r\n\t4.\tTechnology and Tools:\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation on any specialized technology or tools employed by the NYPD for the detection and tracking of ghost guns from January 1, 2019, through the date this request is processed.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords pertaining to partnerships or collaborations with private entities, including tech companies, for the development or use of tools related to ghost gun prevention.\r\n\t5.\tStatistics on Confiscations and Arrests:\r\n\t\u2022\tComprehensive statistics on confiscations of ghost guns by the NYPD during the specified period.\r\n\t\u2022\tData on arrests made by the NYPD in relation to ghost guns, specifying charges filed and outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, the NYPD has a legal obligation under the FOIA to conduct a thorough search for all responsive records. This obligation is supported by case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tNational Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense (2004):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case establishes the principle that agencies must conduct comprehensive searches and cannot rely on overly broad or restrictive interpretations of FOIA exemptions.\r\n\t\u2022\tDow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice (1986):\r\n\t\u2022\tThis case underscores the obligation of agencies to make a good-faith effort to search for responsive records and provides guidance on the scope of such searches.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these legal precedents, I request that the NYPD take all necessary measures to ensure a thorough and diligent search for the requested records. Any failure to do so would constitute a violation of FOIA obligations.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease adhere to your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted, and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your thorough attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

        "communication": "**New York Police Department Records Access Unit**  \r\n**One Police Plaza, Room 110-C**  \r\n**New York, NY 10038**  \r\n**Attn: FOIA Officer**\r\n\r\n**RE: Formal Appeal of FOIL Request Denial \u2013 Documents on Ghost Guns and Related Statistics (FOIL #2024-056-12595 and #2023-056-30666)**\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally appeal the denial and handling of my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request as outlined above. The original request was filed on December 23, 2023, and the subsequent denial was issued on May 13, 2024.\r\n\r\n**Basis for Appeal**\r\n\r\nThis appeal challenges the NYPD\u2019s compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and established judicial precedents mandating exhaustive and transparent records search and disclosure:\r\n\r\n1. **Failure to Conduct Adequate Search**  \r\n   Per **National Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense**, 880 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1989), agencies are compelled to perform an adequate search for documents, tailored to uncover all pertinent documents. The administrative closure of my request suggests a procedural deficit, either in the scope or execution of the search, contravening this mandate.\r\n\r\n2. **Non-Adherence to Good-Faith Standards**  \r\n   As determined in **Dow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice**, 917 F.2d 571 (D.C. Cir. 1990), there is an obligation for agencies to demonstrate good faith in processing FOIA requests. The premature closure of my request, categorized as a duplicate, without substantial examination or justification, reflects a departure from these established good-faith standards.\r\n\r\n3. **Presumption in Favor of Disclosure**  \r\n   According to **Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts**, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989), there is a presumption in favor of access to government documents. The NYPD\u2019s denial, absent a compelling, specific justification, appears to contravene this fundamental FOIA principle.\r\n\r\n4. **Inadequate Justification for Withholding Documents**  \r\n   **NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.**, 421 U.S. 132 (1975), asserts that any denial of FOIA requests must be accompanied by a detailed justification, linking specific exemptions to the withheld documents. The response to my request lacks such detailed justification, undermining the statutory requirements.\r\n\r\n**Demand for Compliance and Re-evaluation**\r\n\r\nIn light of these points, I demand a comprehensive re-evaluation of my request, ensuring adherence to FOIA\u2019s rigorous standards. Non-compliance will compel me to initiate further legal action, potentially including litigation, to enforce statutory rights under FOIA and related case law.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion and Urgent Call for Action**\r\n\r\nPlease address this appeal as prescribed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), which necessitates a response within twenty business days. Any delay must be substantiated with a credible, detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. I expect your prompt and positive resolution to reaffirm the principles of transparency and accountability that are fundamental to our democratic governance.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter  \r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist  \r\nTransparencyReport.pw  \r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu",

I engaged with our\r\ninsurance company to make sure that I was providing you with the correct\r\ninformation. Attached please find a brief written summary from the\r\ninsurance company as well as two attached documents. Our insurance\r\ncompany does not issue \"surety bonds\", but you can see from the response\r\nthe information that is being shared with you. Please let me know if you\r\nhave any questions.\r\n\r\nThis policy will cover the four items on the request.  This is the current\r\npolicy issued by Community Insurance Corporation.  The declarations page\r\nlists the policy number and coverage limits.  Finally, all the people\r\nlisted on the request meet the definition of who an insured is.  Please see\r\nSection III on page six of the first attachment.\r\n\r\n*Steve Summers*\r\nExecutive Director of Operations\r\nWaunakee Community School District\r\n608-849-2 <608-849-2168>000 ext 8012 | fax: 608-849-2354 |\r\nwww.waunakee.k12.wi.us | 905 Bethel Circle Waunakee, WI 53597 |\r\nBusiness Services Website\r\n<http://www.waunakee.k12.wi.us/district/Business_Services.cfm>\r\n\r\nBusiness Services for Staff WebSite\r\n<https://sites.google.com/a/waunakee.k12.wi.us/wcsd-business-office/>\r\n\r\n*Confidentiality Notice**: *This email message, including any attachments,\r\nis for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain\r\nconfidential and/or privileged information.

Specifically, I seek records that include each request's file number, the date received, a brief description of the information sought, and the nature of the response (granted, denied, or partial release).\r\n\r\nRecords responsive to your request are attached. Please note that your request was partially denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b). The Freedom of Information Act states: (1) When a request is made to inspect or copy a public record that contains information that is exempt disclosure under this Section, but also contains information that is not exempt from disclosure, the public body may elect to redact the information that is exempt. The public body shall make the remaining information available for inspection and copying. Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: ... (b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order. Private information is defined as \"unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.\" 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5). Private information also \"includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to\r\nany person.\" Id. Furthermore, signatures have been determined to be unique identifiers, thus \"private information\" by the Public Access Counselor opinion in 2010 PAC 9838. Accordingly, dates of birth, social security numbers, tax identification numbers, home addresses, cell phone numbers, personal phone numbers, and email addresses have been redacted from the attached records.\r\n\r\nPlease note that our FOIA logs do not include information regarding the Department's response. Please note that the existence of a request does not mean the Department has jurisdiction or possession of the records being requested. For example, requestors who asked for records pertaining to physicians were referred to the Illinois Department of Financial Professional Regulation, which is the agency that actually oversees the practice of medicine-that is, physicians.\r\n\r\nYou may request a review of this partial denial by contacting the Office of the Public Access Counselor at:\r\n\r\nLeah Bartelt, Public Access Counselor\r\nOffice of the Illinois Attorney General\r\n500 South 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, IL 62701\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov<mailto:public.access@ilag.gov>\r\n877-299-3642\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to file for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court for Sangamon County or the county where you live (5 ILCS 140/11). If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this partial denial letter (5 ILCS 140/9.4(a)). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this partial denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of further assistance, you can contact me at DPH.FOIA@Illinois.gov<mailto:DPH.FOIA@Illinois.gov> or by telephone at (312) 814-3577.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatricia C.

This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. \r\n\r\nThe City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000293-090824 I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n \r\n  *  Attorney-Client Privilege \u2013 Government Code sections 7927.705 and 7930.110; Evidence Code sections 952 and 954; Bus. & Prof. Code section 6068 \u2013 Records which are exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including those relating to privilege, are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Attorney Work Product \u2013 Government Code section 7927.705; Code of Civ. Proc. section 2018.030 \u2013 Writings that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Deliberative Process Privilege \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing the deliberations of agency officials used to reach a decision. \r\n  *  Preliminary Drafts and Similar Materials \u2013 Government Code section 7927.500 \u2013 Any preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business are exempt from disclosure. \r\n  *  Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v.

Public Interest Balancing Test \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000 -- On the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk \r\ncc: Amy Cunningham, City Manager \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department conducted a search and is providing you with the first batch of non-exempt email communications responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 and 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive records containing personal information (i.e., addresses, cell phone numbers, and discussion of personal matters) are being provided to you with redactions or withheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department will continue to provide you with the copies of responsive, non-exempt records on\u00a0a rolling basis. The Department estimates that it will be providing additional responsive records by October 11, 2024, and will notify you should anything change.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records in order to conduct research on a matter of public interest. I believe that these records will be helpful in understanding the activities of these individuals and their impact on the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For example, during the identified time period, Eva Collins appears in the \u201cto\u201d and/or \u201cfrom\u201d fields of 23,943 emails. We will need to review each email to check for protected information (such as student identifiers or privileged legal communications). The same will apply to the other forms of electronic communications.\r\n\r\nI want to get you what you\u2019re looking for as quickly and efficiently as possible. Perhaps we could break this request into pieces and work on one piece at a time? If you like, we could search first for communications sent/received between these five employees and produce those records to you. We can then move through the remainder of the request in whatever order you prefer. Please let me know if this approach would be acceptable to you.\r\n\r\nI have begun identifying potentially responsive email records.

        "communication": "Hi Sarah,\r\n\r\nThanks for the detailed update - it's much appreciated. I wanted to clarify that we are looking for electronic communications that include any one (or more) of the five named individuals in the \"to\", \"cc\", or \"from\" fields, not necessarily all five at once. We get that this makes for a lot of messages, but it's what we need for our inquiry. Let's stick with the plan of tackling this in chunks and going in reverse chronological order. This seems like the most practical approach given the volume of records.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: will the search include other forms of electronic communication apart from emails? For instance, we would be interested in instant messages from Microsoft Teams if they're available.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your response and hearing about the next steps. Thanks again for your work on this.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPAC Bellevue",

We initially intended our request to be focused as follows:\r\n\r\nWe are looking for electronic communications where at least one of the named individuals is in the \"from\" field, and at least one of them is also in either the \"to\" or \"cc\" fields. Our original revision was meant to capture this \u2014 we don't need every single message where these individuals are present, but those messages where they are directly communicating with each other. This approach should narrow down the search considerably compared to any communication where these individuals are merely included.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, could you confirm if other forms of electronic communication like instant messages, specifically from Microsoft Teams, will be included in this search?\r\n\r\nThanks for bearing with us and helping clarify these details.",

I appreciate your prompt response regarding my public records request, PRR No. 22759. After reviewing the estimated cost of approximately $900.00 to scan the 6,000 records, I would like to explore the possibility of setting up a payment plan for this fee.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of my work as an investigative journalist, managing expenses is crucial, and while I'm committed to covering the costs, it would be more manageable for me to make payments over time.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide information on whether the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife offers payment plans or if we can discuss a structured payment schedule? I want to ensure that I can receive the requested records while also meeting my financial obligations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if it's possible to proceed with the scanning of the records while we work out the payment plan details, please let me know. This would allow me to start reviewing the materials as soon as possible for my investigative work.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your guidance on this matter.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJordan Lassiter",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFiles relating to or mentioning the the Apollo Affair, a 1965 incident in which a US company, Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC), in the Pittsburgh suburbs of Apollo and Parks Township, Pennsylvania was investigated for losing 200\u2013600 pounds (91\u2013272 kg) of highly enriched uranium, with suspicions that it had gone to Israel's nuclear weapons program. \r\n\r\nIn February 1976 the CIA briefed senior staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) about the matter, stating that the CIA believed the missing highly enriched uranium went to Israel. The NRC informed the White House, leading to President-elect Carter being briefed about the investigation. Carter asked for an assessment by his National Security Advisor, whose staff concluded \"The CIA case is persuasive, though not conclusive.\"\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Based on your description of the records you are seeking, we estimate completion of your request will be on or before June 9, 2016.   \r\n\r\nPlease know that this date roughly estimates how long it will take us to close requests ahead of yours in the respective track and complete work on your request. The actual date of completion might be before or after this estimate, based on the complexity of all of the requests in the simple track. We will advise you of any change in the estimated time to complete your request. In an effort to process your request promptly, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the volume of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of assessing fees in accordance with our regulations (10 CFR 9.33), we have placed your request in the following category:  News Media Representative. If applicable, you will be charged appropriate fees for: Duplication Only.  \r\n\r\nA sheet has been enclosed that explains in detail the fee charges that may be applicable. Please do not submit any payment unless we notify you to do so.\r\n- 2 -\r\n\r\nThe following person is the Government Information Specialist who has been assigned responsibility for your request:  Stephanie Blaney at 301-415-6975 or Stephanie.Blaney@nrc.gov.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions on any matters concerning your FOIA request, please feel free to contact the assigned Government Information Specialist or me at (301) 415-7169.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoger D.

Fees (above the minimum fee charge) cannot be waived for this category of requester. \r\n\r\nEducational, Non-Commercial Scientific, News Media and Privacy Act: Fees may be charged only for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an Educational or Non-Commercial Scientific Institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a Representative of the News Media; or a person requesting his/her own records that are in a Privacy Act system of records. No fee is charged for the first one hundred pages of duplication for this category of requester.\r\n\r\nNon-Excepted: For any request not described above (Non-Excepted), fees may be charged for document search and duplication. No fee is charged for the first two hours of search time or for the first one hundred pages of duplication for this category of requester.\r\n\r\n\r\nFee Schedules  \r\n\r\nFee schedules provide only for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication, or review. Review costs include only the costs for initial examination of a document to determine whether it must be disclosed and to determine whether to withhold portions that are exempt from disclosure. The fee schedule is as follows:\r\n\r\nSearch & Review \r\nConducted By\t\t       \t\tRate\r\n\r\n  ! SES/COMMISSIONER\t$90.53/hour\t(ES-maximum)\t\r\n\r\n  ! PROFESSIONAL\t$56.36/hour\t(GG-13, Step 6)\r\n\r\n  ! CLERICAL\t\t\t  $25.16/hour\t(GG-7, Step 7)\r\n\r\nDuplication Charges\t\t  $.20 per page\r\n\r\nFees for non-standard search or duplication will be charged at the actual cost (e.g. providing copying of audio tapes or conducting computer searches).\r\n\r\nMinimum Fee: No fee will be charged unless the fee is equal to or greater than $25.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Pay Fees\r\n\r\nIf we estimate that fees will not exceed $25.00 or you have stated in your request a higher amount that you are willing to pay, we assume your willingness to pay up to $25 or the amount stipulated and you will be billed after we have completed your request. \r\n\r\nIf we estimate that fees will exceed $25.00 or any amount that has been stated by you in your request, we will not proceed with your request until we have notified you and obtained your agreement to pay the estimated fees. \r\n\r\nIf we estimate fees will exceed $250, you will be required to pay the estimated fees in advance before we proceed further with your request. If, while processing your request, we find that the actual fees exceed the estimated fee, we will obtain your consent to pay the additional fees before continuing to process your request.  If the actual fees to process your request are less than any advance payment you have made, you will be refunded the overpayment amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFee Waivers \r\n\r\nA waiver or reduction of fees may be granted for furnishing documents if a requester, by fully addressing the eight factors in 10 CFR 9.41, clearly demonstrates that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.",

There is an Executive Summary, Appendix A (UNCLASSIFIED), and Appendix B (with Proprietary Information Removed).\r\n\r\nThese contain the following:\r\n\r\nThe Executive Summary\r\n\r\n-        Safeguards Requirements in the mid-1960s\r\n\r\n-        The AEC Philosophy of Financial Responsibility\r\n\r\n-        Physical Protection Program Deficiencies\r\n\r\n-        Material Control and Accounting Program Deficiencies\r\n\r\nAppendix A (UNCLASSIFIED)\r\n\r\n-        Discussion of the old security program that is not in place any more\r\n\r\nAppendix A (CLASSIFIED) would continue to be withheld under Ex. 1 because some of the information may still be in place at different plants.\r\n\r\nAppendix B (with Proprietary Information Removed)\r\n\r\n-        General discussion of the lack of rigor in the old safeguards program, again this is not in place any more\r\n\r\nI searched previous FOIA requests and the only other types of records I found were some decommissioning documents that are already publicly available.  We did have 2 similar requests to yours that came in back in 2011 and 2008 and both of those the NRC responded with No Records as well.  Please let me know if you\u2019d like me to provide you these responsive records.  If you are not interested in these please let me know and we can close your request.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay, but I had to get responses from all offices.\r\n\nThank you again,\r\nStephanie Blaney\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\r\n301-415-6975",

There may be additional information in storage from the previous Chairman during that time, however if there is we are confident that likely that information is marked Classified and would still remain classified, which wouldn\u2019t be released.  If these records are located they would need to have a declassification review completed, which we are anticipating would remain classified.

You may limit this request to records created between June 18, 2020 and the date of the processing of this request. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

You may limit this request to records created between June 18, 2020 and the date of the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\"\r\n\r\nPlease confirm whether the information requested is still needed. If we do not hear from you by October 05, 2024, the request will be closed.\r\n\r\nIf different information is now needed.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Mr. Kevin David Mitnick. Born August 6, 1963 in Van Nuys, California. Mr. Mitnick died July 16, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. His death at age 59 was widely reported in the media in July, 2023. He was a computer hacker and social engineer who subsequently became an American political prisoner who was emblematic of the then U.S. Government's overreaction to hackers, and hacker culture.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Mr. Mitnick. Major media outlets across America as of July 20th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/kevin-mitnick-dead-hacker.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-hacker-dies/\r\n\r\nHis cause was championed by 2600 magazine (\"The Hacker Quarterly\"), and additional relevant records for Mr. Mitnick and the campaign to free him, may be found in relation to 2600 magazine.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Mr. Kevin Mitnick.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Mr. Mitnick including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nMr. Kevin Mitnick was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

Please provide any records that fall within the scope of this request , including but not limited to : \r\n\r\nMemos \r\nEmails \r\nLetters \r\nDirectives \r\nPolicy documents \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.535, subdivision (a), this message shall serve as a formal response to your request. This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. The City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000305-103024  I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to\u00a0 Government Code section 7922.000 - Personally Identifying Information; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. As such, we have redacted personally identifying information including home addresses, telephone numbers, license plate numbers, etc. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk cc: Amy Cunningham, City Manager \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney",

This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. The City has reviewed your request and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.540, the responsive records are available using the following link: City Records Request - N000307-103024  I reviewed the responsive documents and determined certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will therefore not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n\r\n Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights. As such, we have redacted personally identifying information including home addresses, telephone numbers, license plate numbers, etc. Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.600, please let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk \r\ncc:Amy Cunningham, City Manger \r\nGary Bell, City Attorney \r\nConor Harkins, Assistant City Attorney \r\nMackenzie Anderson, Assistant City Attorney",

This data should include amounts billed and collected to civilian emergency patients of services performed within the given years. Please provide this data as a CSV file.

Box 15616\r\nWilmington, DE 19850\r\n\r\n3) Contracts between the Department of Treasury and any other Private Collections Agencies (PCA) between 2016 and 2021. \r\n\r\n4)  PCA compliance reviews between 2016 and 2024.\r\n\r\n5) Formal findings memo regarding PCAs compliance alongside responses by PCAs to each finding with corrective actions, if any.\r\n\r\n6) Complaints made to PCAs or the  Cross-Servicing call center that mention or refer to medical debt between 2016 and 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tInstructions Regarding \u201cLeads:\u201d \u2013 As required by the relevant case law, Department of Treasury , show follow any leads it discovers during the conduct of its searches and performs additional searches when said leads indicate that records may be located in another system. Failure to follow clear leads is a violation of FOIA\r\n2.\tRequest for Public Records \u2013 Please search for any records even if they are already publicly available. \r\n3.\tRequests for Electronic and Paper/Manual Searches - I request that searches of all electronic and paper/manual incidences, filing systems, and locations for any and all records relating or referring to the subject of my request be conducted. \r\n4.\tRequest for Search of Filing Systems, Indices, and Locations \u2013 I request that Department of Treasury . Search all of its offices and components which are likely to contain responsive records\r\n5.\tRequests regarding photographs and other visual materials \u2013 I request that any photographs or other visual materials responsive to my request be released to me in their original or comparable forms, quality, and resolution. For example, if a photograph was taken digitally, or if Department of Treasury , maintains a photograph digitally, I request disclosure of the original digital image file, not a reduced resolution version of that image nor a printout and scan of that image file. Likewise, if a photograph was originally taken as a color photograph, I request disclosure of that photograph as a color image, not a black and white image. Please contact me for any clarification on this point. \r\n6.\tRequest for Duplicate Pages \u2013 I request disclosure of any and all supposedly \u201cduplicate\u201d pages. Scholars analyze records not only for the information available on any given page, but also for the relationship between that information and information on pages surrounding it. As such, though certain pages may have been previously released to me, the existence of those pages within new context renders them functionally new pages. As such, the only way to properly analyze released information is to analyze that information with its proper context. Therefore, I request disclosure of all \u201cduplicate\u201d pages. \r\n7.\tRequest to Search Emails \u2013 Please search for emails relating to the subject matter of my request.\r\n8.\tRequest for Search of Records Transferred to Other Agencies \u2013 I request that in conducting its search, Department of Treasury , disclose releasable records even if they are available publicly through other sources outside of the organization. \r\n9.\tRegarding Destroyed Records \u2013 If any records responsive or potentially responsive to my request have been destroyed, my request includes but is not limited to any and all records relating or referring to the destruction of those records. This includes, but is not limited to, any and all records relating or referring to the events leading to the destruction of those records. \r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SCOPE AND BREADTH OF REQUESTS\r\n\r\nPlease interpret the scope of this request broadly. Department of Treasury  is instructed to interpret the scope of this request in the most liberal manner possible short of any interpretation that would lend to a conclusion that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTIONS AND SEGREBALITY\r\n\r\nI call your attention to President Obama\u2019s 21 January 2009 Memorandum concerning the Freedom of Information Act in which he states:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA\u2026The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA. \r\n\r\nIn the same Memorandum, President Obama added that government information should not be kept confidential \u201cmerely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because of errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, President Obama ordered that \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the case of doubt, openness prevails\u201d\r\n\r\nNonetheless, if any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt from production, FOIA statues provide that even if some of the requested material is properly exempt from mandatory disclosure, all segregable portions must be released. If documents are denied in part or in whole, please specify which exemption(s) is (are) claimed for each passage or whole document denied. Please provide a complete itemized inventory and a detailed factual justification of total or partial denial of documents. Specify the number of pages in each document and the toal number of pages pertaining to this request. For \u201cclassified\u201d material denied, please include the following information: the classification (confidential., secret or top secret); identity of the classifier; date or event for automatic declassification or classification review or downgrading; if applicable, identity of official authorizing extension of automatic declassification or review past six years; and, if applicable, the reason for extended classification beyond six years.\r\n\r\nIn excising material, please \u201cblack out\u201d the material rather than \u201cWhite out\u201d or \u201ccut out.\u201d I expect, as provided by FOIA, that the remaining non-exempt portions of documents will be released. Please release all pages regardless of the extent of excising, even if all that remains are stationary headings or administrative markings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholdings serve no important public interest. \r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records with administrative markings and pagination included. Please send a memo (copy to me) to the appropriate units in your office to assure that no record related to this requests are destroyed. Please advise of any destruction of records and include the data of the authority of such destruction. \r\n\r\nFORMAT \r\n\r\nI request that any release stemming from this request be provided to me in digital format (soft copy) via email, or via USB DRIVE, COMPACT DISK, or other like media. \r\n\r\nFEE CATEGORY AND REQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI am an investigative journalist who has written for major media including Business Insider, Time, Fortune, and The Nation Magazine. I am willing to pay any reasonable expenses associated with this request, however, as the purpose of the request is disclosure in full conformity with the statutory requirements for a waiver of fees, I formally request such a waiver. I request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \r\n\r\nShould my request for a fee waiver be denied, I request that I be categorized as a member of the news media for free purposes. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTekendra Parmar",
