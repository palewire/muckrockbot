The current database schema, data dictionary, or other reference document(s) regarding all databases used by CVPD to track drone flights.\r\n2. Data (or other records) that show complaints made to the department that include the word \"drone\" or drones\", these complaints should include those made through the online submission form: Service Complaint Forms (https://www.chulavistaca.gov/departments/police-department/service-complaint-form).\r\n3. Any and all records detailing internal investigations into employee misuse or abuse of drones from any database the department uses to keep track of internal investigations, such as IA Pro.  The relevant fields could include, \"Occurred date Case/CAD/Incident No Employee ID/Serial number First name Last name Date hired Incident type Directive Finding Finding date Action taken Employee Type\" as well as narrative information about the misconduct.  \r\n\r\nAs required under the statute, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the statute.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at this email, please cc dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com on any correspondence. WIRED\u2019s legal counsel is also receiving a copy of this request. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under the provisions of the statute.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
