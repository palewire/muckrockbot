Specifically, I seek documentation regarding the recent directive that instructs officers and command staff to conduct traffic enforcement exclusively on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the processing of this request, please provide:\r\n\r\n1. Any memos, emails, or internal communications from agency leadership discussing or promoting the strategy to issue tickets solely on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\n2. Statistical data or reports that outline traffic enforcement activities, including the number of tickets issued on Wednesdays compared to other days of the week.\r\n\r\n3. Any relevant guidelines or policies that mandate or suggest certain days for traffic enforcement over others.\r\n\r\n4. Information on the objectives behind this strategy and whether any analysis was conducted before its implementation.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee waiver for this request based on the public interest in transparency around law enforcement practices. This information is crucial for understanding how these policies may impact public safety and the fair application of traffic laws.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This is a free feature of Flock. This is not an add-on or analytics subscription.\r\n\r\n5) Lastly, I request all available audit data from the \"Flock\" audit tools. This should include the organization audit, network audit, and sharing report.\r\n    A. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\n    The report should include data logged from the period of installation to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done by the City.\r\n\r\n    B. Network Audit in Flock.\r\n    The report should include data logged from the period of installation, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the City\u2019s Flock network by any agency the City has shared with in the Flock System.\r\n\r\n    C. Sharing report in Flock.\r\n    The report should include flock networks shared with The City and networks The City is sharing its network with.\r\n\r\nFlock maintains documentation on these reports. Flock documentation says the reports can be pulled in 31 day increments.  Flock also says that customers may want to contact support for requests longer than six months or for large accounts. If production of audit logs requires support from Flock, please declare such needs and have the City's point person on the Flock support ticket provide updates on their progress.  Please note that license plate numbers are public information or it would be unsafe to display them. Drivers would also be able to hide their plates in their trunk if they were meant to be private.  Officer usernames are similarly publicly available by many resources, such as news reports, court cases, case notes, and reports.\r\n\r\nI request that files be supplied in their original electronic, machine readable format rather than being converted to any alternate formats. Where multiple formats are available for export, I request csv, xls, or other spreadsheet compatible formats.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Michael Michael: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P066023-012526.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Jessica Riley \r\n330-978-8228\r\njlr00026@mix.wvu.edu",

Smith, County Clerk\r\n40 West Main Street, Room 101\r\nBuckhannon, WV 26201 \r\n\r\nDear, Carol Smith, \r\n\r\nUnder the West Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a729-B-1-1 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that pertain to Williamstown City\u2019s opioid settlement funds. Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\nSincerely, Drew Solt\r\n740-243-6793\r\ndrewsolt@yahoo.com",
