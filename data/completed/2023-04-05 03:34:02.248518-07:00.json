Include any emails from John Mannix, Karen Mooseker, Keith Stefenson and District Office staff that have anything to do about any complaints from staff against Cisco Gomez.

This will take a significant amount of time.  Therefore, we invite you to narrow your request.  Are there any more specific terms you would like to provide regarding specific complaints or individuals for whom you are looking for records?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with your request as written, please let me know and I will update the expected timeline for processing the request.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

In particular, does start_date mean the date that someone first started working for the state, so it should theoretically never change even if the employee leaves and then comes back? \r\n\r\nThank you for all of your time and assistance -- I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBen",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Youth Services Records Access Officer: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n  1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DYS custody (including \r\n  either detained or committed youth) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, \r\n  hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate \r\n  the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, \r\n  ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n \r\n  2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n    a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance) as to how your \r\n    agency operates or utilizes GPS monitoring,\r\n    b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n    c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n   d. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants on ELMO,\r\n   e. The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n   f. Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between the Department of Youth Services and the \r\n   Massachusetts Probation Service or its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DYS custody on expedited release under \r\n   community supervision or \r\n \r\n       3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the Department of Youth Services\u2019s custody, on expedited release under community supervision or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n            l. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n           m. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n           n. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, expedited release under community supervision etc.)\r\n           o. Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n           p. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n           q. Age of individual\r\n           r. Gender of individual \r\n           s. Race of individual\r\n           t. Ethnicity of individual \r\n           u. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n           v. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the \r\n            violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Youth Services. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

I have\r\n    previously written about the government and its activities, with some\r\n    reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation\r\n    of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating\r\n    them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the\r\n    relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not\r\n    required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126\r\n    (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15\r\n    (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as\r\n    well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the\r\n    request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7\r\n    552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative\r\n    of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for\r\n    which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    \r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Copies of Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COAs) granted to the FBI\r\n    from 1995 to the present, along with applications/requests submitted by the\r\n    FBI regardless of whether they were granted or not.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Once you acknowledge you would like to proceed with this request, I can provide you with an estimated cost of the search. Please note that the estimate is for costs associated with searching DOC records and is no guarantee that any responsive records exist. We may not locate any records responsive to your request, and you will still be charged the search fee. If responsive records are located, then those documents allowable for release will be made available to you.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nBetsy\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D91C29.FFFDA4B0]",

I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the records you sent over only have medical fees, but not room and board costs charged to those incarcerated in your facilities. I have found statutory evidence that suggests the department is authorized to collect room and board fees. Below for your reference is the statute:\r\n\r\nSec. 33.30.201.   Compensation of prison inmates; deductions; disbursement; liens. \r\n (a) Each prisoner who is productively employed, as defined in AS 33.30.191(g)(1) or (3) \u2014 (5), may receive for that work compensation at a rate determined by the commissioner under this section if the money is available from legislative appropriations. Compensation established by the commissioner under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065; however, if required to comply with a federal statute or regulation, a higher compensation may be established by the commissioner.\r\n(b) If compensation established under (a) of this section is 50 percent or more of the minimum wage established in AS 23.10.065, the commissioner may deduct the cost of confinement of the prisoner up to the statewide average cost of confinement before disbursements are made under (c) of this section.\r\n(c) The commissioner shall disburse compensation received under (a) of this section, after any deduction required by (b) of this section, in the following order of priority:\r\n     (1) for support of the prisoner's dependents, if any;\r\n     (5) for the payment of fees for the prisoner's utilities services under AS 33.30.017;\r\n\r\nI would like to request all reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding the room and board fees assessed to those incarcerated in Alaska DOC facilities or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding room and board costs, including the number of individuals charged and the total amount of room and board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMercy Loyo",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

These are public records totaling 63 pages and 9 videos. Due to file size, the records referenced above are available for download at: https://uofi.box.com/s/tfjptsz5nockn1h96hq133e1gvds8mfy.\r\n\r\nThis link will expire in 10 days.

If you do choose to view the file in the Box interface, the download button appears as a white arrow at the top right of the viewing window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome records provided to you are in XLS format.

Pursuant to Section 1-7 of that Act, those records are confidential and may never be disclosed to the general public (705 ILCS 405/1-7).\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(b) that exempts from disclosure \"Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\" This includes personal telephone numbers, license plate numbers, home addresses, driver's license numbers, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(c) that exempts from disclosure \"Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\" This includes dates of birth, race, and victim and suspect identification information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7(1)(d)(iv) that exempts records that would \"unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies.\" The requested documents include information about the identity of (or information provided by) person(s) who provided information to a law enforcement agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   140/7.5(bb) that exempts from disclosure \"Information which is or was prohibited from disclosure by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\" This includes juvenile law enforcement records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a right, under the law, to seek a review of this response by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General.

Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

On 8/29/2022, we advised you that your request expedited processing was denied, and your request was assigned to the appropriate Justice Management Division (JMD) staff office for processing.  For your information, the JMD and the Department of Justice (Department) assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  We can report that your FOIA request was assigned to the JMD Human Resources Staff (HR) office for action and response. As mentioned above, each request is handled on a \u201cfirst in - first out\u201d basis in relation to other requests in that same track.  Currently, that office is processing 23 other Complex FOIAs that are ahead of you in their queue. We have contacted HR to see if they can provide us with any additional information to pass onto you.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-514-3101 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).  Please be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be some delay in the processing of your request.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Anything below will not be viewable to staff. --- \r\n\r\n03/30/2023 \r\nRose Terse, \r\nAs per our last message, and because we have not received further information from you by the deadline we provided, we are closing your request as complete. If you do have further questions, please reach out to Records directly at 425-452-6917, or you can submit a new request via our records portal. This concludes our search of records in the custody of the Bellevue Police Department. Your request is now closed; we have nothing additionally responsive to this request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. \r\nPer the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. \r\nIf you believe the information furnished has been incorrectly redacted or is incomplete, you may file a written appeal. The appeal must include your name and address, a copy of the redacted document and a copy of this letter together with a brief statement identifying the basis of the appeal. Please mail your appeal to: \r\nBellevue Police Department \r\nAttn: Records Supervisor \r\nP.O. Box 90012 \r\nBellevue, WA\u00a0 98009-9012 \r\nThank you, \r\nJessica Abbott \r\nBellevue Police Department RPC 4.4 Inadvertent Disclosure Notification: CR 26 (b) (6) Claw Back Provision *** Please read this notice carefully *** \r\nDear legal practitioner: Please take notice that we take reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of privileged or confidential materials, including those protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine, when responding to request for records.\u00a0 These precautions include, but are not limited to, carefully locating and assembling responsive records, performing an intra-departmental review of the records for purposes of determining whether they contain any privileged or confidential materials, forwarding the records to the County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for independent legal review, meeting and conferring with the Prosecuting Attorney's Office to compare and reconcile any conflicting results of our separate independent reviews and, if necessary, creating a withholding log.\u00a0 Despite our having taken these precautions, occasionally a mistake is made and privileged or confidential documents are inadvertently produced.\u00a0 To that end, we wanted to notify you that there is a possibility that the records being produced may contain privileged or confidential materials.\u00a0 The inadvertent or unintentional production of privileged or confidential documents, without a privileged or confidentiality designation should not be considered a waiver in whole or in part of any claim of privileged or confidential treatment, and any document that initially is produced without bearing a privileged or confidentiality designation may later be so designated.\u00a0 In the event that you believe you have received privileged or confidential materials, we would ask that you promptly notify us of this fact and take action as necessary to comply with the obligations set forth in Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4 and/or Civil Rule 26 (b)(6).",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nWe have released today the police report associated with this incident. Kindly note that documents have been redacted, pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act, R.I.G.L. \u00a7 38-2-2(4)(D)(c), to prevent the disclosure of information which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and R.I.G.L. \u00a7\u00a7 11-49.3-2(b) and 38-2-2(4)(S) because they are \"records, reports, opinions, information, and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law, or rule of court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is footage from one or more body-worn cameras associated with this incident; it constitutes the remaining document responsive to your request, as the City does not have \"dash-cams.\" The Public Records Unit has conducted an initial review of the responsive documents and has determined that it will take 9 hours of search, retrieval, review and redaction to respond to your request. Under the Access to Public Records Act, the City may charge $15 per hour for search, retrieval, review, and redaction, with the first hour free. See R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 38-2-4(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you wish to obtain this video, you will be charged $120 for this request. Please note that this is just an estimate and you will be charged based upon actual time and costs. Please further note that nothing in this message is a determination that the footage is a public record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly note that the time to respond to your request is tolled pending receipt of your authorization and prepayment in the amount set forth in the estimate. Checks made payable to the City of Providence may be sent to: Public Records Unit, 444 Westminster Street, Suite 220, Providence, RI 02903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Providence.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

See Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a). The Executive Chamber employs nearly 300 individuals and does not maintain records in a manner that allows all records sent and received by all employees on a given day to be readily accessed, segregated, and reviewed.\u00a0 The broad scope of your request does not sufficiently describe the records you seek to enable the Executive Chamber to conduct a search and locate responsive records. \nPlease respond to this letter by providing a list of Executive Chamber custodians to enable the Executive Chamber to conduct a search and locate responsive records. If you do not respond to our letter within 7 days with additional information permitting us to conduct a search, we will consider your request denied and the matter closed. Pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a), you have thirty (30) days to take a written appeal of this determination.\u00a0 You may appeal by writing:\u00a0 FOIL Appeals Officer, Executive Chamber, State Capitol, Albany, New York, 12224.

Dear Sam Mellins, This letter responds to your request dated October 17, 2022, which pursuant to FOIL, requested: Emails between Kathryn Garcia and email addresses containing the following domain names: \nrebny.com \nrelated.com \nvno.com \nhess.com \nmeqs.com \ncoinmint.one \nrxr.com \ntishmanspeyer.com \nnirvana.money \nwebsterbank.com \ndouglasdev.com \ngranitenet.com \nunfinished.com \nmccourt.com \nrich.com \nsomersetpartnersllc.com \ngtlaw.com Please be advised that your request is not \u201creasonably described,\u201d as required by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3).\u00a0 Whether a request is reasonably described may be dependent upon the nature of an agency\u2019s filing or record keeping system and agency employees are not required to engage in herculean or unreasonable efforts to locate records (see Konigsberg v. Coughlin, 68 N.Y.2d 245 (N.Y. 1986) and the NYS Committee on Open Government\u2019s FOIL Advisory Opinions 18949 and 18863). \n\nYour request seeks records during an unknown time period, as such, it does not \u201creasonably describe\u201d the records requested.\u00a0 See Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a).\u00a0 The Committee on Open Government has explained that \u201ca request for \u2018all\u2019 records, without limitation, that include a certain name, for example, might not be found to reasonably describe the records.\u201d (COOG AO-18949 (Aug. 20, 2012)).\u00a0 As you have been advised on previous FOIL requests for the same records, see below, this Office requires a timeframe to conduct a records search.\u00a0 The broad scope of your request does not sufficiently identify the types of records sought to enable the Executive Chamber to facilitate a search and locate responsive records,and is therefore denied. Furthermore, this FOIL request is a near duplicate to a FOIL request you submitted to this Office on June 3, 2022, assigned FOIL #4172.\u00a0 That request initially sought the same records without a timeframe.\u00a0 On June 6, 2022, this Office asked you to supply a timeframe for the responsive records, warning you that the request as originally written was not reasonably described.\u00a0 On June 7, 2022, you supplied a timeframe, and this Office was then able to process your request.\u00a0 This Office supplied you with records responsive to FOIL #4172 on January 30, 2023.\u00a0 Please note that FOIL does not require an agency to provide duplicates of documents previously provided to you ( Franklin v Keller, 254 AD2d 83; Matter of Huston v Turkel, 236 AD2d 283; Matter of Moore v Santucci, 151 AD2d 677; Matter of Swinton v Records Access Officers for the New York City Police Department, 198 AD2d 165).\u00a0 As such, to the extent this request seeks the same records provided to you under FOIL #4172, it is denied. \n\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a), you have thirty (30) days to take a written appeal of this determination.\u00a0 You may make an appeal by writing:\u00a0 FOIL Appeals Officer, Executive Chamber, State Capitol, Albany, New York, 12224.

Electronic records must not be printed and scanned as that does not constitute a \"copy\" (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098). You must justify every withholding of any information in writing.  You must provide footnotes or other clear references to justify each and every redaction (see ruling against SFPD in SOTF 19098).  If you do not provide correct copies of electronic records or do not justify by footnote or other clear reference each and every redaction, we will ask SOTF to file Official Misconduct charges against Director Henderson before the Ethics Commission, as we did against Chief Scott in SOTF 19112, pursuant to SFAC 67.34.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).
