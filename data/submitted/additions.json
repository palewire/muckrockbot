According to news reports, he had been detailed to multiple agencies in the service of DOGE's activities. I would like to request any SF-50/hiring docs from GSA, including if his position was converted to a different role (or moved from a volunteer to a pay position).\r\n- Jeremy Lewin was hired on or around January 20th. Since then, he has been detailed to several agencies, including USAID and CFPB and has been appointed to positions within both USAID and the Department of State. Nevertheless,  a news report on July 11th indicated that Lewin was still listed in the GSA directory as an employee. Is he still technically an employee of the agency. Is he still detailed to other agencies? He continues to be employed in the federal government.\r\n\r\nI would like to request the SF-50s and other onboarding / offboarding details for these two individuals. If possible, I would also like to request any relevant detailing arrangements for these individuals to other agencies by the GSA (or possibly even back to the GSA from other agencies if Jeremy Lewin's employment has ended at GSA but he has been detailed back from USAID or State).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",
