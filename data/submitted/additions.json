        "communication": "Dear Department of the Interior:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records related to DOI\u2019s coal mascot, \u201cCoalie.\u201d Many responsive records may be located within the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement (OSMRE), but the scope of my request is agency-wide.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Coalie mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to DOI's decision to create a coal mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. If any image of Coalie was created using AI, please produce all AI prompts that were used in the course of creating the image. Please also produce all AI image results that were generated but not ultimately used. \r\n\r\n3. Please produce all Coalie-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Coalie costume. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all communications related to Coalie. This includes internal agency communications, as well as communications sent to or received from non-DOI people, agencies, or entities (public or private).\r\n\r\n6. Please produce any plans or guidelines for how the Coalie mascot will be used.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all documents in which the Coalie mascot appears, including electronic records such as social media posts.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to and processing of this request.",
