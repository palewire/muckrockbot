Records of deployment by facilities under the management CDCR, disaggregated by facility, since January 1, 2018 of projectile launch platforms, such as 40mm projectile launchers, \"bean bag\" or specialty impact munition (\"SIM\") weapons, and \"riot guns\" used to disperse chemical agents; explosives and pyrotechnics, such as \"flashbang\" grenades and explosive breaching tools; and chemical weapons such as \"teargas\" and \"pepper balls\".\r\n\r\nAs a reference, CDCR responded to Public Records Act request #M003971-122821 with spreadsheets of statistical data on deployments since January 1, 2020 of each of these types of equipment system-wide. (see attached) We are requesting such data broken down by facility, since January 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n2. In addition, we request records of deployment of the above types of equipment since January 1, 2018, disaggregated by facility (or, if not available, then system-wide), that contain information (de-identified of individually identifying information) on use of force or injuries as a result of deployment of above types of equipment, including: \r\na) race and age of persons impacted;\r\nb) types of areas in the facility where such force was used or injury occurred through use of the equipment (e.g. yard, cell, cafeteria)\r\nc) number of infirmary or hospital admissions as a result of use of force.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you release information as it becomes available to you, rather than waiting for determinations and reviews on the entire request.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss this request, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, American Friends Service Committee, at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",
