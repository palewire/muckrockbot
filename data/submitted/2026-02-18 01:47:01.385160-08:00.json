        "communication": "Good afternoon, Caroline.\r\n\r\nThank you for your email requesting records. Before I can begin with your search, I\u2019ll need to clarify a few things.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   The Denver City Council is the legislative body for the City and County of Denver. Any agreements approved by the council (which require an expenditure above $500,000) are public documents and you may search this link for any legislation, presentations, or other public records<https://denver.legistar.com/> for the Denver City Council. Note that while Council approves contracts/agreements over $500K, it does not negotiate any city contracts or agreements. That is done by the administration under the mayor\u2019s office or General Services. Information requesting records from other city agencies under the administration is here.<https://www.denvergov.org/Open-Records-CORA>\r\n  *   Your request asks for communications between anyone at the Denver City Council (72 employees total) and \u201cany outside parties such as lawyers, representing the company.\u201d I have no way of knowing who those representatives are or may be without names, domains, email addresses, or phone numbers and therefore cannot include this in any search. The search for the domain Palantir.com is doable.\r\n  *   The policy of the City and County of Denver does not allow me to give any waivers of fees collectable under the Colorado Open Records Act. The current fee structure allows one free hour to search, recover, prepare, and legal review of responsive records. After that, there is a fee of $41.37/hour. Please note that given the wide scope of your request, it will significantly exceed the one hour grace period. Once I get any clarifications from you, I\u2019ll provide a time and cost estimate within three days, as required by the Colorado Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to hop on a call to discuss what you\u2019re looking for to help focus or narrow the request if you would find that helpful. Otherwise, I\u2019ll wait for further clarifications from you so that I can give you an accurate time and cost estimate.\r\n\r\nHave a great day!\r\n\r\nRobert\r\n\r\n[The City and County of Denver Logo with a Large D and the words Denver Office of City Council.]\r\nRobert Austin, APR<https://accreditation.prsa.org/MyAPR/Content/Value/Why_Hire_an_APR.aspx> | Communications Specialist\r\nOffice of City Council | City and County of Denver\r\nPronouns<https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why> | He/Him/His\r\nphone: (720) 337-2018  mobile: (720) 241-2760\r\n311 for city services <https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-311-help-center.html> | denvergov.org/citycouncil <http://www.denvergov.org/citycouncil> | Denver 8 TV<https://denver8.tv/> | Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/DenverCityCouncil/> | Twitter<https://twitter.com/DenCityCouncil>\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, who passed away December 14, 2025, in ICE custody in Pennsylvania. \r\n2. A copy of the ICE ERO or IHSC Significant Incident Report or Significant Event Notification\r\n\r\nAccording to the information currently published on ICE's website, ICE was under a Congressional mandate to release this information no later than 30 days after his death, and to update it no more than 60 days after each immigrant's death. \r\n\r\nI make this request under both 5 USC 552(a)(2) - which governs the agency's affirmative disclosure obligations - and 552(a)(3), which concerns the agency's obligation to respond to a request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv), I seek expedited processing of this request, and certify and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and current understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged information dissemination. See www.MuckRack.com/Andrew-Free.\r\n\r\n2. I research and publish regarding deaths in ICE custody. My work documenting deaths in ICE detention is published, cited, and relied upon by national media outlets, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, the L.A. Times, and others. \r\n\r\n3. As of the date of filing my filing of this request, ICE has not posted its Detainee Death Report for this individual. \r\n\r\n4. There is an urgent need to inform the public about the circumstances ICE is aware of surrounding this death. Congress is currently contemplating alterations to DHS and ICE's funding, and the facts of each death in custody directly impact demands lawmakers and the public may wish to press when authorizing future funding increases, or applying limits to them.\r\n\r\n5. Deaths in ICE custody reached their highest numbers in 20 years in 2025, and they have been the subject of widespread media coverage, and there is significant reason to believe ICE's treatment of people in detention has not met the standards it claims it adheres to when defending its actions in public statements. This coverage has prompted a number of responses by DHS's Twitter page and other public statements, pushing back against the coverage.\r\n\r\n6. I will make the records available to the general public upon receiving them.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All extant video of Chaofeng GE entering the shower area in his pod at the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing center from the early morning hours of August 5, 2026, depicting the period beginning when he enters through the shower stall where he ended his life until the period where he is discovered by GEO staff or detained immigrants. \r\n\r\n2. Any photos of Mr. Ge's remains taken at the MVPC.\r\n\r\n3. Any extant versions of a Significant Incident Report or Significant Event Notification ICE created pertaining to Mr. Ge's death. \r\n\r\n4. The working papers from IHSC's Mortality Review for Mr. Ge's death. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing of this request, and affirm under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements in support thereof are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination. I published edited works in local and national outlets regarding, inter alia, ICE detention and deaths in custody. Www.MuckRack.com/Andrew-Free. I also publish a subscription-based online newsletter about deaths in custody, www.detetentionkills.substack.com. I am a member of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), a professional organization available only to journalists. \r\n\r\n2. According to an autopsy report I have reviewed concerning Mr. Ge's death, he was hogtied with his hands and feet behind his back when his body was found. \r\n\r\n3. While his death was ruled a suicide by hanging by the Coroner, significant speculation about potential abuse preceding Mr. Ge's death has proliferated in the media, causing his family and other detained immigrants at Moshannon, as well as the public, unnecessary pain, confusion, and doubt as to the circumstances surrounding his death. \r\n\r\n4. Adding to the confusion, ICE failed to disclose all the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ge's death in its congressionally mandated Detainee Death Report: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrChaofengGe.pdf. ICE omitted the fact that his hands and feet were bound together behind Mr. Ge's back when his body was discovered. \r\n\r\n5. Due to the confusion ICE's less-than-complete communications have engendered, there is an urgency to inform the public about the circumstances surrounding his death. \r\n\r\n6. Mr. Ge's death and deaths in ICE custody during 2025 have been the subject of widespread media attention about which there exist questions as to the government's adherence to its own standards, and its enforcement of federal laws pertaining to ICE's contractors. \r\n\r\n7. This sustained media attention has drawn official statements by ICE's social media and DHS spokespeople, Congressional questioning, and numerous \"fact-checks\" from the administration. \r\n\r\n8. ICE is poised to add approximately 92,000 beds to its detention system in the next several months. \r\n\r\n9. ICE's FOIA backlog currently stretches back years--meaning treatment of this request in the ordinary course of business will render the answers to questions about Mr. Ge's death moot and purely historical in nature. \r\n\r\n10. GEO's contract with Clearfield County is set for renewal in 2026. Prior to approving that contract, the public has a right to know how Mr. Ge died, and what GEO did to prevent it. Because ICE refuses to affirmatively release this information, expedited processing is necessary to obtain it.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "Dear Michael Michael: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P066679-021626.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

Contracts and procurement records\r\nAll contracts, purchase orders, invoices, licensing agreements, Requests for Proposals (RFPs), and winning bid responses related to the acquisition, installation, maintenance, licensing, or upgrade of security camera systems at Carlmont High School or district-wide. I request these records for the period of January 1, 2018 through the date this request is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request includes documents where Avigilon (including Motorola Solutions), Arecont Vision, or Axis Communications are the manufacturers of the hardware or software, even if the direct contract is with a third-party reseller, system integrator, or installation contractor (e.g., CDW-G, local security vendors, etc.).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I seek records regarding:\r\nHardware: Avigilon H4 and H5A Multisensor series, Axis network cameras, Arecont Vision panoramic cameras, and Network Video Recorders (NVRs).\r\nSoftware: Avigilon Control Center (ACC) software, \"Appearance Search\" feature licensing, facial recognition licenses, and any \"Focus of Attention\" interface licensing.\r\n\r\nProcurement records are likely held by the SUHSD Purchasing Department or Administrative Services.\r\n\r\n2. Internal and external communications\r\nAll email communications between SUHSD staff (specifically: Superintendent, Director of Maintenance & Operations, Director of Technology, Purchasing Managers, and school site administrators [Principals and Vice Principals]) and any representative with an email domain belonging to avigilon.com, motorolasolutions.com, arecontvision.com, or axis.com. I request these records for the period of January 1, 2020 through the date this request is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI also request all internal emails among SUHSD staff containing the specific terms: \"Appearance Search,\" \"Facial Recognition,\" \"LPR,\" \"License Plate Recognition,\" \"AI Analytics,\" \"Unusual Motion Detection,\" \"Avigilon Cloud,\" or \"Watch List\" for the same time period.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting technical configuration logs or password resets, but rather communications regarding the purchase decision, policy implementation, and capability assessments of these systems.\r\n\r\n3. Policies and guidelines\r\nAny written policies, guidelines, memoranda, directives, or Board Policies (BP) and Administrative Regulations (AR) adopted by SUHSD or any individual SUHSD campus governing:\r\nThe use of video surveillance on school grounds.\r\nThe retention schedule for security footage (how long data is kept before deletion).\r\nAccess protocols (who is authorized to view live or recorded footage).\r\nThe use of biometric analysis, facial recognition, or video analytics technology.\r\nAny Data Privacy Agreements (DPAs) signed with security vendors regarding the processing of student images.\r\n\r\nPolicies are likely held by the Superintendent\u2019s Office or Student Services.\r\n\r\nTo assist in determining my fee status, you should know that I am a student journalist writing for Scot Scoop and that this request is being made as part of news gathering for public distribution.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
