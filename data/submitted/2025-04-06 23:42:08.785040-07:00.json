These medical records are crucial to the adoption of these K9s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request encompasses, but is not limited to, all records of complaints received, inspection reports, investigative files, and any other documents generated or compiled by the Bureau in connection with said investigations. Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is crucial to myself, as I am the current adopter of a Contract Working Dog (CWD) that Anne Gibbs had her in possession for a period of time. I state 'Her Possession' because to refer to it as 'Care' would do a disservice to CWD Cezar. He was one of the 28 K9s that were seized from her property, and rescued from PSPCA, where he remained until I adopted him. In addition, this case is  demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved. There are several posts on Anne Gibbs public social media page, which I believe, are possible indicators of continued neglect.\r\n\r\nI currently serve as a K9 Handler in the Private Sector, along with a branch of the Department of Defense. I am a Nationally Certified K9 Handler, with extreme knowledge and certification of these working K9s.  I am also still serving as a member of the United States Army, as a Military Police Officer. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on USB/CD-ROM. I can provide the CD-ROM/USB if requested. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nJulia Valenti\r\nCPT, MP\r\nCommanding\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Thomas Jackson: Your public records request has been received and is being processed in accordance with Florida Statute 119.\u00a0 Your request, received on 4/6/2025, was given the reference number R030722-040625\u00a0for tracking purposes. \r\n Records Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting all records related to a DUI arrest that occurred on November 5, 2024, involving Alexander Finkelstein, conducted by Deputy Christian Swierkowski (Badge #2431) of the St. Lucie County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\r\n\r\nThe incident began with a traffic stop at or near 2501 Orange Avenue, Fort Pierce, Florida, and involved the investigation of suspected impaired driving. The arrest affidavit indicates the availability of body-worn camera footage, as well as photographs taken during the stop and documentation related to a DUI citation (#A16BDAE).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nAll body-worn camera (BWC) footage from any responding deputies\r\n\r\nThe full arrest and incident reports, including any officer narratives\r\n\r\nPhotographs or images submitted as part of the evidence\r\n\r\nThe DUI citation\r\n\r\nAny associated evidence logs or supplemental materials\r\n\r\nThis request is made in the interest of public transparency and to better understand law enforcement procedures during DUI investigations. The incident appears to have been handled without resistance or escalation, making it an appropriate candidate for public review of standard operating procedure involving BWC documentation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThomas Jackson\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fst-johns-county-sheriffs-office-15860%252Fnovember-5-2024-dui-arrest-of-alexander-finkelstein-st-lucie-county-bwc-footage-and-reportsc-184474%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AABKKlGITjSXS8LPfxknYcChNzU%3A1u1bsS%3A4aP-OXGEmZ1FEuiWWTGpFYzy7BnOKHhyED6n8qIaBe4 \r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: \r\n1. If you have requested body camera footage, these requests can be lengthy and will cost a minimum average of $80 but could cost several hundred dollars due to many factors: \r\n  * How long was the law enforcement encounter? \r\n  * How many deputies were on scene? \r\n  * How much redaction will be required for public release?\r\n2. If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed. Thank you for using the Records Request Center. \r\n  My Request Center",
