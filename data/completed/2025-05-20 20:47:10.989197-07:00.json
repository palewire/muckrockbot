You requested, as quoted,\r\n\r\n  *   \"Copies of any and all communications, including emails, email attachments, text messages, voicemails, and memos, held by the Department of Veterans Affairs referencing the Department of Government Efficiency's \"DOGE\" access to agency data systems and records\r\n  *   The list of Department of Government Efficiency \"DOGE\" employees with a \"@va.gov\" email domain.\"\r\n\r\nSearches Dated 2/27/25, 2/28/25, 3/10/25, 3/20/25, 4/9/25, & 4/11/25\r\nOn February 27, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solution (VIEWS), VA's official information system for interagency memoranda, agreement, access requests, contracts.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: DOGE AND (\"information sharing\").  On February 28, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms: DOGE AND access.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Identity and Access Management (IAM) office search for and provide a list of VA information systems that Mr. Justin Fulcher, a Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE, accessed including the last accessed date.  On March 20, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA OI&T IAM office search for the same information for Mr. Cary Volpert, another Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2025, and April 7, 2025, the OI&T IAM office provided such list.  None of the information systems accessed are VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS for Inter-Agency Agreements, Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement, and Inter-Agency Contracts.  On April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: \"DOGE\" AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\").\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms:\r\n\r\n  1.  \"DOGE\" AND \"contract\";\r\n  2.  (\"Government Efficiency\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\"); and,\r\n  3.  (\"Digital Service\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\").\r\nOur searches through VIEWS dated February 27, 2025, February 28, 2025, April 9, 2025, and April 11, 2025 yielded no responsive records.\r\n\r\nAll-Other Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the all-other category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nPlease find attached two (2) pages, which the VA releases in full.  Mr. Fulcher and Mr. Volpert have not accessed any VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. Under the provisions of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the following contact information is provided to assist FOIA requesters in resolving disputes:\r\nVA Central Office FOIA Public Liaison:\r\nEmail Address: vacofoiaservice@va.gov<mailto:vacofoiaservice@va.gov>\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)\r\nEmail Address: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nMailing address:\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\nThis concludes OSVA's Initial Agency Decision to request 25-08907-F.

I already have .pdf files of 6 public memoranda that were released, but are simply no longer on our website. (They were all publicly released prior to April of 2020, which is as far back as the news releases on the site go.)\r\n\r\nI believe there are likely many more public memoranda, but we will need to find the hard copies. In the past, the memoranda were in each office, rather than centralized.\r\n\r\nI am about to start a two-week evidentiary hearing on a habeas corpus case, which will slow my progress. However, I will have our paralegal start looking for the hard copies.\r\n\r\nCordially,\r\n\nBrent Schultze\r\nLead Deputy District Attorney\r\nAppellate Services Unit\r\nSan Bernardino County District Attorney's Office\r\n303 W.

We would like copies of the six public memoranda sent to us by March 28, 2025. As is spelled out in the request, we are requesting to receive records on a rolling basis. As for the remaining review of responsive records, I have a few requests for clarification: \r\n\r\n1) On the remaining 44 names you have reviewed, are you still looking for memoranda on all 44? Or have you determined that responsive memoranda for specific incidents are exempt from disclosure? If you have determined any responsive records are exempt from disclosure, as noted in our request, we expect the legally required determination. \r\n2) On the other 63 cases you have yet to review that are NOT \u201cCurrently Under Review,\u201d when do you plan to make a determination whether or not you have disclosable responsive records? As a reminder, the 10-day determination requirement in Cal Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.535 was Friday 3/14/25 (the request was sent on the evening of 3/3/25 making the date of receipt 3/4/25). \r\n3) On the 52 cases \u201cCurrently Under Review,\u201d we expect the required updates on those responsive records as spelled out in Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 832.7(b)(8). \r\n\r\nAs always, we are happy to answer your questions and look forward to the department's prompt response to this narrowed request. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nKatey Rusch\r\n(510) 516-6277\r\nCalifornia Reporting Project\r\n",

Therefore, responsive materials should include the underlying/governing contract or license agreement, in addition to other amendments, appendices, order forms, etc. that contain terms of use.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the library does not have a direct contractual relationship with ACS, but rather subscribes through a consortium such as California Digital Library or SCELC. However, the library should still have a copy of the contract, as it governs their use of ACS journals. Please check again for a contract with ACS, including any consortial contract that lists San Diego City College as a participating institution.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt assistance!",

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \r\n\r\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25068. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "5/19/2025 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuck Rock News, DEPT MR182995 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25068 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025.  You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \n\nEnclosure(s):\t8 Pages\n",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, Internet Router, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive public records include but are not limited to: invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device service providers, device IP addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nProvide copies of all records documenting the person responsible for the usage of each device.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE.

        "communication": "I am appealing the denial of requested information by the FAA. It appears that the (b)(6) redactions have been made in bad faith, citing concerns for \"harassment.\" Letter from Susan Northrup to FOIA Requester (Jan 2025).\r\n\r\nThe FOIA's Exemption 6 can only be applied when there would be a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 USC 552(b)(6). The FAA has failed to meet the bar to demonstrate that harassment of AAM-300 employees may occur from the disclosure of  names. Indeed, courts have recognized that \"[g]overnment employees, and specifically law enforcement personnel, have a significant privacy interest in their identities, as the release of their identities may subject them to embarrassment and harassment.\" Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279, 296-97 (2d Cir. 1999). But, the employees of AAM-300 are not \"law enforcement personnel\" nor have a \"significant privacy interest in their identities\" Id. \u201cAn agency must at least explain the ground for concluding that there is some factual basis for concerns about harassment, intimidation, or physical harm.\u201d United America Financial, Inc. v. Potter, 667 F. Supp. 2d 49, 55 (D.D.C. 2009). The FAA has failed to explain any ground for its \"concerns about harassment\" Id. The Supreme Court has agreed that \"[n]ames and other identifying information do not always present a significant threat to an individual's privacy interest.\" Wood v. F.B.I, 432 F.3d 78, 88 (2d Cir. 2005) (see Department of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164 (1991)).\r\n\r\nOPM has recognized that release of information about certain employees in specific job categories may \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" See The U.S. Office of Personnel Management Data Release Policy August 2020, (Sept. 1, 2020), https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/data-standards/data-release-policy-august-2020.pdf; 5 USC 552(b)(6). The job codes identified by OPM include officers of the Internal Revenue Service and law enforcement personnel. Absent from OPM's guidance are the job categories that FAA has redacted, such as legal instruments examiners. DOT and similar agencies have already released information for those in the same job category, demonstrating there is no cognizable privacy interest for employees of AAM-300. See, e.g., FedsDataCenter, https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/index.php?y=all&n=&l=&a=&o=LEGAL+INSTRUMENTS+EXAMINING. The information sought is already in the public domain, and FAA employees have \"have no privacy interest in information that is already in the public domain.\" Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 840 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D.D.C. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe FAA has failed to reasonably segregate non-exempt material. Specifically, in the case of names of legal instruments examiners who are exercising delegated approval to sign letters for AMCD Manager, the equities weigh in favor of disclosure, as they have a reduced privacy interest due to their exercising of AMCD Manager's authority.  See Sensor Sys. Support, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 851 F. Supp. 2d 321, 332 (D.N.H. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe decision of the FAA to withhold the requested information should be reversed and remanded.",

Cir. 2025). In its opinion, the D.C. Circuit found that that the Park Police failed to \"provide any concrete basis to conclude that release of [] officers\u2019 names raises threats 'more palpable than mere possibilities'.\" Id. (quoting Dep\u2019t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. at 380 n.19). Here, the FAA's (b)(6) redactions do no better than the Park Police, being \"wholly conclusory, lacking even minimal substantiation\" of AAM-300 employee's \"privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing their names.\" Id. The D.C. Circuit explained that \"[g]eneralities are not enough; showing that a substantial invasion of privacy will occur if [] names are released requires reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements.\u201d Id.

I apologize for the extended time it has taken to answer your email.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires public bodies to produce public records in their possession. S.C. Code Ann 30-4-30. Thus, I am attaching documents responsive to your requests in 1, 2, and parts of 3, and 5. I will send records responsive, in part, to Requests 6, 8 and 9  in a subsequent email.\r\n\r\nFOIA does not require public bodies to create records.   The Citadel does not maintain \"records showing the current number of each uniform item... remaining in stock.\" Request 3; see also Request 9 (football and basketball uniforms).\r\n\r\nCadets are ultimately responsible for cleaning their own uniforms. Requests 4 and 5.  They may do so through the standard laundry fee or through the on campus dry cleaning and laundry facilities, whose rates are available here<https://www.citadel.edu/auxiliary-services/dry-cleaning-and-laundry/>.  The Citadel includes a laundry fee of () as part of the overall tuition and fees it charges cadets.  The Citadel washes football and basketball uniforms in-house, therefore it does not maintain records of that cost. Requests 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nThe Citadel collects tuition and fees as described here<https://www.citadel.edu/sbs/tuition-fees/>.  It receives appropriations from the State of South Carolina as described here<https://www.scstatehouse.gov/budget.php>. Those funds are used to purchase uniforms issued to football and basketball teams.  Request 7.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, cadets purchase uniforms; they do not rent them. Request 12.\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Again, I apologize for the delay in providing this response.\r\nMark\r\n\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\n[Citadel Logo Barracks Brandmark Navy]<https://citadel.edu/>\r\nMark C.

Itemized expenditures are requested for the amount allocated and line-item expenditures to each areas and what was budgeted for each for the selected academic years what will enable analysis of allocated to expended and within expenditures identify what products or services were procured.

I apologize for the extended time it has taken to answer your email.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires public bodies to produce public records in their possession. S.C. Code Ann 30-4-30. It does not require public bodies to create records.  The Citadel does not maintain \"financial records showing ledger level itemized income and expenditures for Uniforms fees\" as you request below.  Creation of such records would require considerable time and expense.  Nonetheless, I am attaching a spreadsheet which describes the uniform items The Citadel requires all cadets to purchase. I am also attaching copies of purchase orders for those items. Pursuant to the College Regulations, available here<https://www.citadel.edu/bov/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2025/04/College-Regulations.Published-version.pdf>, The Citadel's Board of Visitors has ultimate authority over uniform fees and other required charges to cadets.  A summary of all fees is available here<https://www.citadel.edu/sbs/tuition-fees/>.\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Again, I apologize for the delay in providing this response.\r\nMark\r\n\r\n[Citadel Logo Barracks Brandmark Navy]<https://citadel.edu/>\r\nMark C.

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R.

Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.

I am now\r\nsubmitting a standard request form for the same records under the\r\nPennsylvania Right to Know Law.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. I would\r\nprefer that the request be filled electronically, if possible, by e-mail\r\nattachment. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you\r\nwould inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office has received your request for public records and is processing your request. All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2111. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov and include your tracking #.\r\n\r\n***Pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns Executive Order 14185 (\"Restoring America\u2019s Fighting Force\"), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/03/2025-02181/restoring-americas-fighting-force. I request a copy of the report required by Section 5 of the Executive Order, which provides: \"Department of Defense Internal Review.  The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit of DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system.  The report shall be delivered to the Secretary of Defense within 90 days of the date of this order.\"\r\n\r\nThat report was due on or before April 27, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing. See, e.g., FOIA No. 25-F-2201.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Executive Order requiring a report to the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback may impact the final report required of the  Task Force's final report required of the Secretary of Defense to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy on or before July 26, 2025. (See Sec. 7(b) of the Executive Order.)  If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-intelligence-arm-dia-pausing-dei-mlk-holocaust-remembrance-and-other-observations/\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-radical-gender-ideology-dei-initiatives-military\r\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jan/29/pete-hegseth-creates-new-pentagon-task-force-ban-r/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3302523/trump-executive-orders-military-excellence/\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277155/trump-military-transgender-dei-iron-dome-orders\r\nhttps://freebeacon.com/latest-news/die-dei-trump-signs-executive-order-banning-woke-program-in-military/\r\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5129386-west-point-cadet-clubs-ordered-disband/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/branches/air_force/2025-03-20/air-force-base-dei-compliance-visits-17205950.html\r\nhttps://www.expressnews.com/news/article/dei-hegseth-trump-military-dei-air-force-20230989.php\r\nhttps://san.com/cc/naval-academy-removes-close-to-400-books-linked-to-dei-following-dod-order/\r\nhttps://www.fedweek.com/armed-forces-news/dod-task-force-visiting-installations-to-observe-dei-rollback/\r\nhttps://www.iheart.com/content/2025-02-06-west-point-shuts-down-campus-clubs-related-to-race-gender-amid-dei-attacks/\r\nhttps://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",
