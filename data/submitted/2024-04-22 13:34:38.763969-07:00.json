Anderson (October 27, 1947 \u2013 April 21, 2024), who was kidnapped by Hezbollah militants in 1985 and held captive for six years. His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/us/terry-anderson-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Aberle, I am Sixty years old today 04/19/1964. I live in Los Angeles,California. In1996 my grandmother and I recovered a book written in 1490 by his navigator detailing Christopher Columbus\u2019s discovery of the Americas.The book was on tour celebrating the 500yr anniversary of Christopher Columbus in in 1986, visiting the central libraries of NY city then Texas, Los Angeles then San Francisco, the book never made it to San Francisco.It was reported to the insurance company that it was destroyed in the 330 million dollar fire at the Los Angeles Central library, it was then placed in a storage container by the insurance company, when the book was located it was an ordinary book, not the correct 500 year old book. The night we contacted City Hall both my grandmother and I were kidnapped and tortured, the assailants kept asking for the papers in Spanish, we had no idea what they wanted. My father\u2019s, my mother\u2019s and my grandmothers houses were all ransacked, the book was in such good shape, they didn\u2019t notice it was sitting on a table in the den. The Orange County police rescued us two days later. We then returned the book to the Curator of the Christopher Columbus Museum in Spain,I believe it was in Seville. He flew to Los Angeles to personally inspect the book, when he saw it, he wept tears of joy. He spoke Portuguese, so we spoke throughout an interpreter, he said,\u201d He was so happy to see his baby, he thought the book was gone forever! A month or so later I was contacted and told of a clause in contract, that if book was returned their was a 10% of insurance value reward, the book was insured for 12 million US dollars. My grandmother and father decided I was the rightful recipient of the award, but my father and the Spanish government invested the money, I would receive it on my 60th birthday , today. The same people who had originally stolen the book, have made several attempts to get the money, also breaking into our homes and stealing the paperwork multiple times! I am David Aberle the true recipient., no one else is authorized to collect the money. Two women Leslie Ann Brodeur Aberle and her daughter Brianna Jean Aberle  are not related to me,Leslie is one of the original thieves who set the 330 million dollar Los Angeles Central Library fire. They have attempted multiple times to get the money early.I don\u2019t have the information on this matter, but it went through the New York Secretary of State. Please help me with this matter. Sincerely David Aberle. E-mail address sonofgwa1@gmail. Com also apache2024@icloud.com. Phone number 323-775-4387, 3712 Cazador st. Los Angeles, Ca. 90065.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Brooks Aberle",

Lerner\r\n    was involved in an incident in 1944 where he was caught photographing the\r\n    cyclotron installed at UC Berkeley's Radiation Lab. He was also a subject of\r\n    the Hollywood blacklist. Please conduct cross-reference searches with Arthur\r\n    Aleksandrovich Adams and Eric Bernay, two Soviet-affiliated contacts of\r\n    Lerner's. Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100\r\n    years ago.\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and\r\n    companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at\r\n    the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have\r\n    been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the\r\n    destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating\r\n    to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but\r\n    not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said\r\n    records. If previously released records are available, then I request a\r\n    rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are\r\n    located and processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Charles Leo Daniel, who died on March 7, 2024, at the GEO-owned Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between March 7, 2024, and April 17, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Charles Leo Daniel died in ICE custody on December 7, 2024.https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/trinidad-and-tobago-national-ice-custody-dies-nwipc\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Frankline Okpu, who died December 6, 2023, and before that, in the case of Salvador Vargas.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Daniel is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. Public records obtained by advocates in Washington State reveal Mr. Daniel spent nearly four years in solitary confinement at NWIPC, despite having a final order of removal prior to entering the facility. https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2024/03/15/nwdc-conditions-research-update-daniel-death-in-context/ \r\n7. Despite Congressional staff's presence at the facility on the day Mr. Daniel died, staffers found out via a news alert about his death. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/man-who-died-at-wa-detention-site-was-in-solitary-for-years-researchers-say/ \r\n8. Mr. Daniel's Solitary Confinement violated US and international law, which prohibit torture and cruel inhuman, and degrading treatment of detained people, including those with mental illness, via solitary confinement. https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/137-Harv.-L.-Rev.-F.-175.pdf\r\n9. At least 6 people have attempted suicide since Mr. Daniel's death, reflecting an acute mental health crisis within NWIPC. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/at-least-6-suicide-attempts-at-tacoma-ice-facility-911-calls-show/\r\n10. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Tacoma facility.\r\n11. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Daniel's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Daniel's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Tacoma facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 4/17/2024. Specifically, you requested records regarding the death of Charles Leo Daniel. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about Charles Leo Daniel.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in Charles Leo Daniel.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2024-ICFO-31579. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",
