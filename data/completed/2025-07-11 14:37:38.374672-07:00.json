        "communication": "Dear Director at the Office of Information Policy, \r\n\r\nThis letter is in reference to FOIA Request #24-00644-F which you closed on March 25th 2024 after a lengthy response suggesting no responsive documents have met the plain letter language of my FOIA request. I believe this request was closed in error and am humbly appealing your judgement. \r\n\r\n1) In denying this request your office suggested that the request for correspondences was too broad. However, your response does not indicate that an actual search has occurred. In order to help your team limit your search I am rewriting this search to better help guide your search. I am also available for a call if you would like to discuss further refining this search. \r\n\r\n- Emails, letters, and text messages between the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) mentioning \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nI believe this request both specifies types of correspondences, the senders and receivers, and the specific date ranges for which you to search. Operation Broader Sword is a highly publicized operation. (See: https://in.usembassy.gov/u-s-and-india-cooperate-on-operation-broader-sword-to-stop-international-shipments-of-illegal-and-dangerous-drugs-medical-devices/). The DEA's involvement alongside the other agencies has also been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). \r\n\r\nEmails, Text Messages, and Letters sent by public servants in their capacity as public servants are public records. Thus they are FOIA'ble. Retrieving already existing emails, text messages, or letters, is not requesting a new record be created. It is not tantamount to research. \r\n\r\n2) The seizure of 500 shipments of contraband has been highly publicized. (SEE: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/us-india-joint-operation-seizes-500-shipments-of-illicit-prescription-drugs-and-medical-devices/article67053528.ece). DEA rules mandate such records be kept for at least two years (SEE: https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/mtgs/researcher_train/conf_2019/feb_2019/barron.pdf). \r\n\r\nFor this reason, I believe there are in fact responsive documents to the following request:\r\n\r\nAny documents including but not limited to seizure records, arrest records, contracts, reports, intelligence briefings regarding \"Operation Broader Sword\" between January 1st 2022 and the date this request is full-filled.\r\n\r\nA reminder that I am a journalist and this information is being requested in the public interest to shed light on the cross-border illicit drug trade impacting US citizens. It is in the public's interest to know about the inflows of such material into the country and therefore I am requesting a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nLastly, the FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests. The retrieval of already existing documents is not research. It is the FOIA officers job to find responsive public documents to a request or provide specific statute exemptions for why a FOIA request hasn't been completed. This has not happened in this case. \r\n\r\nConsidering the myriad of media reports about this operation, I believe responsive documents do in fact exist. Please provide a timeline in which you can conduct a reasonable search for these documents. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time. I am available on the following phone number if you'd like to chat more +1 347 770 4163 / +1 347 775 7522.",

I also seek any statistical reports, dashboards, or complaint trend summaries reflecting activity related to Safety National during this period.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Fecteau",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nA copy of the historical study Office of Personnel: The Position Management and Compensation Division, 1946-1967.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n1. The specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern: \r\nI am writing to formally appeal the denial of my request for records under the Oklahoma Open Records Act (\u201cORA\u201d), which I submitted on 3/26/25. I respectfully request a written explanation detailing the specific grounds for the denial, including the precise subsections of the ORA that are being relied upon.\r\nAccording to the ORA, \u201call records of public bodies and public officials shall be open to any person for inspection, copying, or mechanical reproduction during regular business hours\u2026\u201d unless specifically exempted by law. Your response cited the Oklahoma Open Records Act generally, referring to Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and 20, but did not indicate what specific subsections within those provisions justify withholding the records I requested.\r\nTo ensure that the denial complies with the legal requirements of the ORA, and to allow me to properly evaluate the legitimacy of the denial, I ask that you provide the following:\r\nThe specific subsection(s) within ORA Sections 2, 5, 8, 14, and/or 20 that are being relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A description of how those subsections apply to the records I requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A list or description of the categories of records being withheld in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Whether any portion of the requested records is non-exempt and therefore subject to partial disclosure with redactions, as required by Oklahoma law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is clear: ORA emphasizes transparency and access to public records as a matter of public policy. The Act requires that denials be specific and justified under the law; vague or categorical denials are inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the Act.\r\nI respectfully request a response to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within seven (7) business days of receipt, so that I may determine my next steps.\r\nIf you require any clarification regarding my original request or this appeal, please let me know promptly.\r\nThank you.\r\n",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\n\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\n\nEMAIL RECORDS\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\n\nFEES\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\n\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\n\nEXEMPTION LOGS\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\n\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nGood Luck. \r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fking-county-sheriffs-office-2399%252Fking-county-sheriff-jlarc-2024-agency-costs-fulfilling-public-records-requests-including-litigation-for-the-year-2024-179629%252F%253Femail%253DKCSOlegal%252540kingcounty.gov&url_auth_token=AAATlkFknXebZY40DLJRN3WT-o4%3A1tXMN3%3AUwXr1fpq7PuOqdtdYBDOcUsm02jNLyGb5d7ngXDPuP8 \r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nWLYNMJMC \r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 179629-51818793@requests.muckrock.com \r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 179629 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. RCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. WAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified,a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. \r\nPlease reply directly to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\n\r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nGood Luck. \r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fking-county-sheriffs-office-2399%252Fking-county-sheriff-jlarc-2024-agency-costs-fulfilling-public-records-requests-including-litigation-for-the-year-2024-179629%252F%253Femail%253DKCSOlegal%252540kingcounty.gov&url_auth_token=AAATlkFknXebZY40DLJRN3WT-o4%3A1tXMN3%3AUwXr1fpq7PuOqdtdYBDOcUsm02jNLyGb5d7ngXDPuP8 \r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nWLYNMJMC \r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 179629-51818793@requests.muckrock.com \r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 179629 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

(Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.000.) The public interest must be weighed whether such disclosure \u201cwould contribute significantly to public understanding of government activities\u201d and serve the legislative purpose of \u2018\u2018shed[ding] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties.\u2019\u2019 ( City of San Jose v. Superior Court\u00a0(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1019.) Here, disclosure of this record would not significantly contribute to an understanding of the City\u2019s performance or duties. Moreover, the release of this information could result in the misuse of documents intended for sensitive public safety incidences.\u00a0 For these reasons, in weighing the public interest, the City finds that the public interest served by nondisclosure of these types of records outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. \r\nSincerely, \r\nDoberne #3797 \r\nPolice Records Supervisor \r\nSanta Monica Police Records",

Our office receives over 12,000 records requests annually, one of our main priorities is to provide those responsive records to your request in a reasonable timeframe and as efficiently as possible. In order to do that we would like to work with you to identify possible ways to narrow your request so that we are only searching for and reviewing those records that contain the information you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the most time intensive records to review are APD lapel video (a 1-hour recording requires 3-4 hours to review and redact). In most cases, the first responding officer\u2019s lapel video contains the information most requesters seek. If you are able to narrow/tailor your request to that officer\u2019s lapel it can avoid tens to hundreds of hours of review and redaction (which results in additional time needed to respond to your request).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to proactively reach out to our office, we will work with you to better understand your records request and will offer suggestions on ways your request can be further specified to obtain those records you seek as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invitation to contact our office to narrow your request is voluntary and does not alter any of your rights to inspect public records under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act. If you decline our offer to assist in narrowing your request, we will conduct a reasonable search and process your request accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have or later acquire documents relating to your request, please let us know and upload the records into NextRequest. Such additional information has proven to be a useful resource in identifying, locating, and producing additional records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDominic Leyba\r\n\r\nIPRA Tech\r\n\r\nOffice of the City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Albuquerque.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

NOTE: This includes: all but the last four digits of a (1) taxpayer ID number; (2) financial account number; (3) credit/debit card number; (4) driver\u2019s license number; AND (5) all but the year of a person\u2019s date of birth; AND (6) social security number; AND (7) nonelected government employee\u2019s home street address, but not the city state or zip code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also determined it was necessary and appropriate to redact/blur the officers\u2019 computer screen videos to avoid potential disclosure of information from the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC). See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21-21, .33). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI redacted/exempted visual depictions of great bodily harm in law enforcement records. NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(5); and NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including the City of Albuquerque\u2019s Open Records Ordinance, ROA 1994, Section 2-7-6-5(C)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* * Lapel Videos - Part 1 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)\r\n\r\n* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos.\u00a0The videos provided are from the officers most directly involved in this incident.\u00a0There are approximately 183 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos (if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lapel videos responsive to your request were shared with you via Evidence.com; you will receive a link from Evidence.com which will prompt you to create an account in order to view the videos. If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos.

If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos. Additionally, the videos are only active for 90-days, but you may download them at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* Lapel Videos - Part 2 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos.&nbsp;There are approximately 183 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n* The Dialysis Center S. Parking Lot video&nbsp;may not play in Evidence.com. You can download it and view it in a media player on your computer, though. We use a program called \"VLC Media Player\" to view these types of videos. It is a free player that you can download.\r\n\r\n* The Traffic Cameras video&nbsp;is a special format that can only be viewed using the \"Genetec Video Player,\" which has been provided to you through Evidence.com as well. It is just an EXE file and does not install; it just runs off the file directly.\r\n\r\n* \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos&nbsp;(if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list reflects my understanding of the records that have been completed and processed and the records on which we are still working.&nbsp;If you have a different understanding or believe there are other records outstanding, please contact me as soon as possible.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be notified when additional records become available. Thank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: protected personal identifier information contained in the requested records was redacted pursuant to NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have [redacted] portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to IPRA, NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1(A) (medical records); \u00a7 14-6-1(A) (medical records); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, to avoid potential disclosure of restricted personal information from the state Motor Vehicle Division system. See NMSA 1978, \u00a714-2-1(L)(as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a720.21-21, \u00a720.21-33).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI redacted visual depictions of great bodily harm in law enforcement records. NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(5); and NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including the City of Albuquerque\u2019s Open Records Ordinance, ROA 1994, Section 2-7-6-5(C)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe any records are missing from your request based on information you have please let us know. Please send us a message with this information or upload the records that would assist us into NextRequest. Such additional information has proven to be a useful resource in identifying, locating, and producing additional records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, please contact the City Clerk's office at (505) 924-3650 for assistance in troubleshooting.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER C.

Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $80 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2014 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefor.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

A comparable request submitted recently to another regional law enforcement agency was processed with a significantly shorter timeline and a projected fulfillment date of May 27, 2025. This suggests that the records I\u2019ve requested\u2014 which are routinely maintained by public agencies\u2014 may be reasonably accessible without requiring such an extended delay.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the materials may require review or redaction. However, under RCW 42.56.520, agencies are required to provide the \u201creasonable estimate\u201d of time necessary to produce records, and I respectfully ask for more detail as to what is contributing to this 60-business-day estimate.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I also request that responsive records be released on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than in a single, delayed release. I am open to narrowing or prioritizing specific sections of my request to assist in timely fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and attention. I look forward to your response and hope to work collaboratively to ensure the timely release of these important public records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAurora Quinn",

Salary Records: Current and historical salary data for all personnel, including base pay, overtime, special assignment pay, and bonuses. \r\nI will be coordinating your records request with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). My apologies for the very long estimate that was initially sent to you. I was out of town and one of the records staff at JCSO sent that estimate based on their perception of the size of your request. We do actually intend to produce records by installment as records are located, compiled and review is completed. A few of your request items are relatively simple and can correspondingly be produced relatively quickly. However, unless I'm misunderstanding any details, the overall scope of your request appears to be massive. I have taken the liberty of numbering each of the bulleted items in your request, for ease of reference. I would guess that 27 of your requests, taken together, comprise a significant portion, probably a majority, of all of JCSO's administrative records. Many of the requested records will require detailed review and redaction which is a time-consuming process. Some of the requested records will also require third party notice to be sent to subjects of the records, which will also add to the overall processing time for those records. Given limitations in personnel and the need to prevent excessive interference with other essential operations, it will take a period of many months to complete all 27 items of your request. But, as I mentioned, we will produce records by installment as they are compiled, prepared and reviewed. Some of the records you are requesting exist in paper files only. The county charges 10 cents a page for scans of paper records, so there will be some charges for certain installments along the way. The total cost of all charges will almost certainly be well in excess of $25. Each time we anticipate charges for a certain installment, we will first send you an estimate of the charges, showing an estimate of the number of pages to be scanned. We estimate that public records responsive to this request will be available within nine business days from today, on or before 5/30/2025. If public records become available in advance of this estimate we will contact you promptly. Conversely, if the County encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will contact you promptly with a revised estimated date. Thank you for your patience in awaiting this information.

To that end, I would be happy to work with you to identify an initial set of 10\u201315 high-priority categories that can be compiled and released earlier in the process. If you could advise which of the requested items are more readily accessible or less resource-intensive to produce, that would help me focus the request accordingly. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a simple tracking update or log indicating the current status of each category as they move through review and preparation. This would help me monitor progress and plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your willingness to produce records on a rolling basis and for providing advance estimates of any anticipated charges.

The items we identified for this \"first round\" are numbers \r\n1, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, and 20. \r\nYou asked for something like a tracking update or log to track the progress of each item.\u00a0 The best way to approach this is to create a new request in our public records request system for each item when we begin working on it. These will be essentially sub-requests. The sub-requests will give both you and us an easy way to track the progress of each item. All of the records produced for an item will be stored in that item's sub-request and provided via the sub-request. Also all communication regarding each item, including time estimates for providing installments of records can also be conducted via the corresponding sub-request. All of the sub-requests will appear as individual requests in your account and each of them will have its own reference number that gets generated when it's entered. I'll be creating a few of these sub-requests today and you'll get an automatic acknowledgement email from each one as it's created. \r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or objections about any of this. \r\nThank you, Ken Hugoniot \r\nJefferson County Public Records Administrator \r\n1820 Jefferson St. \r\nPort Townsend, WA 98368 \r\n(360) 385-9174 \r\nkhugoniot@co.jefferson.wa.us (mailto:khugoniot@co.jefferson.wa.us)",

Before proceeding with payment or next steps, I would like to take time to refine the scope of the requested records to ensure clarity and reduce unnecessary time and cost for both parties.\r\n\r\nI am currently reviewing the following 27 requested items and will be preparing a refined, tiered list identifying:\r\n\u2022\tWhich items apply to current employees only vs. former employees (and how many years back, e.g., last 3\u201310 years),\r\n\u2022\tWhich apply specifically to sworn officers vs. administrative staff,\r\n\u2022\tWhich categories should be prioritized first for delivery.\r\n\r\nI also acknowledge that you have already provided:\r\n\u2022\tThe personnel roster of current employees (Item #1) via the Muckrock portal,\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #10 (Early Intervention System Data),\r\n\u2022\tA formal response indicating no responsive records for Item #20 (Body-Worn Camera Misuse or Policy Violations).\r\n\r\nWhile I reserve the right to revisit these items or seek administrative appeal later, if necessary, I will focus for now on refining the scope of the remaining requests. Please also note that I intend to process all communications and records delivery solely through the Muckrock portal to keep everything centralized.

The Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (PAO) provided two versions of their Brady list. The list in PDF format is the currently used list which is more up to date. The Excel spreadsheet version is the previously-used version which is no longer kept up to date, but it contains some information that is not included in the current list. The PAO issues potential impeachment disclosure (PID)\u00a0letters pertaining to both Jefferson County Sheriff officers and Port Townsend Police Department officers, so those are included in the responsive records. Please log in at the following link to retrieve your responsive records: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003642-052225  These may be all of the responsive records, but it appears that there is at least one PID letter missing. I will need to inquire with the PAO regarding any remaining unlocated records. Meanwhile, if you have any additional questions or issues pertaining to the records produced in this installment, please don't hesitate to contact me. If any additional records are located, we estimate the next installment to this request will be available within five\u00a0business days from today, on or before 7/11/2025. If you experience any difficulties accessing the Public Records Center or downloading your documents, please contact me as soon as possible for assistance. Sincerely, Ken Hugoniot \r\nPublic Records Administrator \r\nCentral Services \r\nJefferson County \r\n360-385-9174",

Dear Aurora  Quinn, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office received the following public records request from you on April 30, 2025: (3) Internal Affairs Complaints Logs \r\nPlease provide logs or records of complaints filed against sworn officers from January 1, 2015 to the present, including: \r\n* Date of complaint \r\n* Name(s) of officer(s) involved \r\n* Badge number(s) \r\n* Nature/type of complaint \r\n* Summary of allegations \r\n* Status and outcome \r\n* Date investigation closed \r\n* Disciplinary action taken (if any) \r\nIn response to your records request, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has provided the full internal affairs log that is maintained by their office. The log includes all types of internal affairs incidents combined in one table. In addition to complaints the log includes use of force incidents, pursuits, workplace injuries and equipment/vehicle damage incidents. The log does not include: \r\nBadge number \r\nDate investigation closed The disposition column contains a small amount of information about disciplinary action taken for investigations that were upheld, but the information doesn't appear to be entirely consistent. For current employees, badge numbers can be located by cross-referencing employee names from the IA log with names in the current employee roster, which I've included in the downloads with the IA log file. Since the records of all investigations will be provided to you in response to other items in your overall records request, those documents will include all the details of the investigations, including the date that the investigations were closed and any disciplinary action that was taken. Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve your responsive documents: Sheriff Public Records Request - S003640-052225  All responsive records have been produced and the request is now closed. This completes, closes, and provides Jefferson County's final, definitive response to this request. If you have any difficulty retrieving your documents, please contact me for assistance as soon as possible. Jefferson County will take no further action on this request. If you have questions regarding the processing of this request or would like to initiate an administrative appeal regarding the response to your request, please do so at your earliest opportunity.\u00a0You may also seek judicial review of our response to your request for a period of one year, beginning as of the date of this message, consistent with RCW 42.56.550.

It does not include all of the information you've requested. There is no summary-type of information (such as would be included in a spreadsheet) regarding disciplinary or investigation findings related to employee separations. The most concise responsive records for that would be any investigation reports related to separations. Those reports would also be responsive to item #14, so we can provide them in response to item 2 or item 14, or both. Please let me know your preference. Once I receive a reply from you I can update you on the status of both items. The spreadsheet we provided does not include badge numbers. Badge numbers assigned to former employees are eligible for reuse and can be assigned to new employees. The Jefferson County sheriff's office does not maintain an updated list of badge numbers of former employees.

For example, a records request for similar data fulfilled by the Beverly Hills Police Department of Beverly Hills, CA provided a Customer Management Report generated by the Redflex System. That provided Customer Management Report is attached to this request for reference.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\n* Number of Potential Violations collected by the Redflex System between the periods of January 2020 to December 2025, preferably segregated by year or month\r\n\r\n* Number of Authorized Violations collected by the Redflex System between the periods of January 2020 to December 2025. This may also be the number of Electronic Signatures given by the Authorized Officer using the Redflex\r\n\r\n* Monthly reports generated by the Redflex Standard Report System, as mentioned in Section 7.8.2 of the AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF FREMONT AND REDFLEX TRAFFIC SYSTEMS, INC. FOR PHOTO RED LIGHT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM (a copy of this agreement is attached to this request for reference)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Doe",
