        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nMonthly electronic listings of all employees of the Missouri Executive Branch from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022. Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

U.S. regulations purportedly implementing this statute allow for the removal of a person granted deferral under CAT to the very country they\u2019ve shown they\u2019d be tortured, provided certain conditions are met. 8 C.F.R. 208.17(f) & 208.18(c). A person can be so removed, under these regulations, if the Secretary of State forwards Diplomatic Assurances to the Attorney General from the country that the Attorney General previously found (through a removal proceeding) would be more likely than not to torture an individual, the inquiry before the immigration court is over. 8 C.F.R. 208.18(f) & 208.18(c)(1)-(3). \r\n\r\nDiplomatic Assurance Removals under CAT -Executive Process \r\nAccording to these regulations, at least four nodes must exist in the determination of Diplomatic Assurances, and in executing removals under them. First, the Secretary of State must obtain the assurances. 8 C.F.R. 208.18(c)(1). This likely requires coordination with State Legal (L), Consular Affairs (CA), and other bureaus within the Department of State. Second, State must forward to the Attorney General, and the AG must make a determination as to whether these assurances are sufficient. That determination cannot be delegated below a deputy (DAG) level within the Department of Justice. 208.18(c)(2). Third, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), acting through an Immigration Court or Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), must vacate the deferral, and refrain from entering any other proceedings. 208.17(f) & 208.18(c)(2). Fourth, ICE must execute the removal order. \r\n\r\nDescriptions of Records Sought\r\nOur goal in seeking these records is to understand how frequently the U.S. government tries to deport people to countries its own courts have found are more likely than not to be tortured by invoking the Diplomatic Assurance Removal process under its Convention Against Torture (CAT) regulations, and how often it succeeds. \r\n\r\nWe will gladly refine the scope of our request and the terms of searches in collaboration with your office in service of this goal. We do not seek cumulative records of the same process from different offices within the same agency through this request and expressly agree to narrow as such. \r\n\r\nCategory 1. How many diplomatic assurances were secured by the Secretary of State pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 208.18(c)(1)? \r\nPlease provide any record from a relevant component or official within your agency listing the total number of cases in which Diplomatic Assurances under CAT were obtained during FY15, FY16, FY17, FY18, FY19, FY20, FY21, and FY22 (FY15-22).\r\n\r\nCategory 2. How many diplomatic assurances were sought by the U.S.? \r\nPlease provide any record showing the total number of individual cases in which the U.S. government sought diplomatic assurances using the process described in 208.18(c) during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 3. How many removals did the U.S. carry out subject to diplomatic assurances? \r\nPlease provide any record showing the total number of removals the U.S. executed for individuals after receiving diplomatic assurances that they would not be tortured in the country to which the individual is being removed during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 4. Countries from whom Diplomatic Assurances were Received. \r\nPlease provide any record showing all countries from which the U.S. received diplomatic assurances during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 5: Monitoring of Diplomatic Assurances. \r\nTrust, but verify. This is generally how the U.S. conducts foreign policy and diplomatic commitments on things it cares about. Torture is supposed to be one of those things. One way to measure how much government does about the things it says it cares about\u2014things like torture\u2014is to inquiry about the records it creates to monitor those things. If there are no records of U.S. agencies following up about individual cases for whom they\u2019ve received diplomatic assurances to check down the road and see whether the assurances could be relied upon, it would be harder to believe the government takes seriously its obligation not to return individuals to places where they\u2019ll be tortured. On the other hand, a regularly scheduled report or monitoring alert system would be evidence of the seriousness the government shows its obligations to avoid deporting people to torture. \r\n\r\n5A. Please provide any record during FY15-22 evidencing efforts by your agency to follow up any state\u2019s treatment of any individual removed pursuant to diplomatic assurances under the CAT regulations, as described in Category 3.\r\n\r\n5B. Please provide any calendar entry or meeting agenda referencing your agency\u2019s monitoring of people removed pursuant to Diplomatic Assurances as described in Category 3. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your prompt attention to this request, and your commitment to transparency and accountability in government. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAL Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDiplomatic Assurance Removals under CAT - Regulatory Background\r\nU.S. law implementing the Convention Against Torture (CAT) creates a statutory right not to be deported to a country where a person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, acting through the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), that it is more likely than not they will be tortured if they are removed to that country. U.S. regulations purportedly implementing this statute allow for the removal of a person granted deferral under CAT to the very country they\u2019ve shown they\u2019d be tortured, provided certain conditions are met. 8 C.F.R. 208.17(f) & 208.18(c). A person can be so removed, under these regulations, if the Secretary of State forwards Diplomatic Assurances to the Attorney General from the country that the Attorney General previously found (through a removal proceeding) would be more likely than not to torture an individual, the inquiry before the immigration court is over. 8 C.F.R. 208.18(f) & 208.18(c)(1)-(3). \r\n\r\nDiplomatic Assurance Removals under CAT -Executive Process \r\nAccording to these regulations, at least four nodes must exist in the determination of Diplomatic Assurances, and in executing removals under them. First, the Secretary of State must obtain the assurances. 8 C.F.R. 208.18(c)(1). This likely requires coordination with State Legal (L), Consular Affairs (CA), and other bureaus within the Department of State. Second, State must forward to the Attorney General, and the AG must make a determination as to whether these assurances are sufficient. That determination cannot be delegated below a deputy (DAG) level within the Department of Justice. 208.18(c)(2). Third, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), acting through an Immigration Court or Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), must vacate the deferral, and refrain from entering any other proceedings. 208.17(f) & 208.18(c)(2). Fourth, ICE must execute the removal order. \r\n\r\nDescriptions of Records Sought\r\nOur goal in seeking these records is to understand how frequently the U.S. government tries to deport people to countries its own courts have found are more likely than not to be tortured by invoking the Diplomatic Assurance Removal process under its Convention Against Torture (CAT) regulations, and how often it succeeds. \r\n\r\nWe will gladly refine the scope of our request and the terms of searches in collaboration with your office in service of this goal. We do not seek cumulative records of the same process from different offices within the same agency through this request and expressly agree to narrow as such. \r\n\r\nCategory 1. How many diplomatic assurances were secured by the Secretary of State pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 208.18(c)(1)? \r\nPlease provide any record from a relevant component or official within your agency listing the total number of cases in which Diplomatic Assurances under CAT were obtained during FY15, FY16, FY17, FY18, FY19, FY20, FY21, and FY22 (FY15-22).\r\n\r\nCategory 2. How many diplomatic assurances were sought by the U.S.? \r\nPlease provide any record showing the total number of individual cases in which the U.S. government sought diplomatic assurances using the process described in 208.18(c) during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 3. How many removals did the U.S. carry out subject to diplomatic assurances? \r\nPlease provide any record showing the total number of removals the U.S. executed for individuals after receiving diplomatic assurances that they would not be tortured in the country to which the individual is being removed during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 4. Countries from whom Diplomatic Assurances were Received. \r\nPlease provide any record showing all countries from which the U.S. received diplomatic assurances during FY15-22. \r\n\r\nCategory 5: Monitoring of Diplomatic Assurances. \r\nTrust, but verify. This is generally how the U.S. conducts foreign policy and diplomatic commitments on things it cares about. Torture is supposed to be one of those things. One way to measure how much government does about the things it says it cares about\u2014things like torture\u2014is to inquiry about the records it creates to monitor those things. If there are no records of U.S. agencies following up about individual cases for whom they\u2019ve received diplomatic assurances to check down the road and see whether the assurances could be relied upon, it would be harder to believe the government takes seriously its obligation not to return individuals to places where they\u2019ll be tortured. On the other hand, a regularly scheduled report or monitoring alert system would be evidence of the seriousness the government shows its obligations to avoid deporting people to torture. \r\n\r\n5A. Please provide any record during FY15-22 evidencing efforts by your agency to follow up any state\u2019s treatment of any individual removed pursuant to diplomatic assurances under the CAT regulations, as described in Category 3.\r\n\r\n5B. Please provide any calendar entry or meeting agenda referencing your agency\u2019s monitoring of people removed pursuant to Diplomatic Assurances as described in Category 3. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your prompt attention to this request, and your commitment to transparency and accountability in government. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAL Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021\r\n\r\nVia email: publicrecords@bsd405.org\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.\tI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",
