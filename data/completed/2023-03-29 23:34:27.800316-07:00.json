Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It must be something that does not require the district to create data, generate new documents or organize data to create a record that does not already exist. Regarding the request for public comments related to active shooter/assailant concerns, the Carson City School District does not have a record such as what you are requesting, and creating or assembling this information would be outside of the manner in which the information is kept in our ordinary course of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the above response, the district considers the request answered and will take no further action.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.  On November 14, 2022, the District received the following public records request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n3. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2020. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n4. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2020 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2020.\r\n\r\n5. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2019. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n6. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2019 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges receiving your request.  The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges receiving this request.  The District has assigned it the number R000177-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain, the District is currently working on providing you with all responsive records to your original request. Richland School District Policy 4040 \u2013 Public Records Request provides in part, \u201cWhen the same requester simultaneously submits multiple, separate requests or makes one or more additional requests when previous requests are open, the District may queue the requests in the order in which they were received. The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.  Within twenty working days after the District completes request # R000001-020722, it will provide you with the first installment of responsive records to request #R000175-111622. Then within twenty workings days after the District provides you with all responsive records to request ##R000175-111622, the District will provide you with the first installment of the responsive records to request #R000176-111622. And within twenty working days following completing request ##R000176-111622,the District will provide you with the first installment of request #R000177-111622. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGalt L.

As you can imagine, producing complete copies of all public records requests received by the District and its responses to those requests between November 14, 2021 and November 14, 2021 including all abandoned requests and requests for video records takes a great deal of time. The District has worked diligently to answer your organization\u2019s original request.\r\n\r\nThe District mailed you the most recent installment to your original request on Friday, December 2nd via USPS. The tracking number is 9505 5125 9791 2336 5843 64. It should be delivered today.\r\n\r\nAs I stated previously, District policy provides that the District is not required to work on separate requests made by the same requester at the same time. Therefore the District is working on your original request and then will work to answer your request number R000175-111622 that was received by the District on November 16th. \r\n\r\nAs I stated previously, you can re-prioritize your requests. If you wish the District to move your request for JLARC records to the front, please let the District know.  Again, the District is committed to answering all five of the different public records requests that your organization have made to the District.

Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are copied on an email from Dr. Shelley Redinger - Superintendent Richland School District from Dr. Redinger's \"@rsd.edu\" email address, including Nancy.Mayer@rsd.edu (Nancy Mayer - Executive Assistant to Superintendent and School Board) Nayomi.Munguia@rsd.edu (Nayomi Munguia - Records Specialist), and Tim.Praino@rsd.edu (Tim Praino - Executive Director of Human Resources) do you believe these are all the same person because each email address ends in @rsd.edu? \r\n\r\nHow about the wide world of @gmail.com? One great big \"organization?\" All the same \"person?\"\r\n\r\nYou went to law school right? Gonzaga University, J.D., 1998? Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) #28996 (attachment). I suspect you are a competent guy. This entire obtuse \"what is an email?\" exercise is a stain on your credibility.\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Are there different employees of Muckrock making different requests? Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\"\r\n\r\nI would direct you to the text at the bottom of EVERY request passed through the MUCKROCK website portal on behalf of public records requestors, it was included in my 11-15-22 request and it's real clear:\r\n\r\n\"PLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\"\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, no employee of Muckrock has ever made a single public records request of the Richland School District. I doubt they ever will.\r\n\r\nYou can however count on the growing plethora of unhappy citizens of Richland, Washington as well as the parents of kids in the Richland School District to request public records from your agency to better understand the questionable decisions and choices that have been made by Richland School District employees and School Board members concerning public money and public education in their community. \r\n\r\nI have nothing to do with the MUCKROCK organization other than to use their service to make a public records request.\r\n\r\nI am a private citizen of the State of Washington. \r\n\r\n\"RCW 42.56.030 - Construction.\r\n\r\nThe people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected.\"\r\n\r\nI hope this provides requested \"insight.\" Frankly, I find this banal back and forth to be a complete waste of time. \r\n\r\nI suggest your public agency work as directed with all due diligence and haste per the revised code of Washington to produce the identified records requested. Fail not at your peril, under penalty of law.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\n Good Afternoon: The District is in the process of mailing you the next installment of records that are responsive to your records request.\u00a0 Previously you directed the District that you do not wish to use the District\u2019s third-party public records platform (GovQA). Since that time, the District has been mailing you thumb drives containing files of responsive records. \r\nThere have been some questions about the fees the District charges related to public records request.\u00a0 The District\u2019s policy and procedure can be found that the following links: https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577 \r\nThe District Procedure 4040, states that the District charges the actual costs of mailing to requestors.\u00a0 Further it also provides: c. Cost for Electronic Records. The cost for providing electronic records is as follows: 1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records; 2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery; 3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and 4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device (flash drive) provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge. \r\nThese fees are also reflected in RCW 42.56.120(2)(a)-(c) which states, \u201c (2)(a) Agency charges for actual costs may only be imposed in accordance with the costs established and published by the agency pursuant to RCW (7), and in accordance with the statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs. In no event may an agency charge a per page cost greater than the actual cost as established and published by the agency.

To the extent the agency has not determined the actual costs of copying public records, the agency may not charge in excess of: (i) Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of agency equipment to photocopy public records; (ii) Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to scan the records; (iii) Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery; and (iv) Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of agency equipment to send the records electronically. The agency shall take reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner available to the agency in its normal operations; and (v) The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the agency, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge. (c) The charges in (b) of this subsection may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request \r\nThe District will continue to produce responsive records. The District estimates it will be mailing you the next installment of responsive records in the next five working days. \r\nIf you have any questions or if I have misunderstood your request in any way, please let me know, \r\nGalt L.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

Your request has been assigned tracking number FP-22-004070.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised this office is not a repository for documents. Therefore, we must determine where the information you have requested would be located and request a document search be conducted by the relevant records custodians.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to process your request at this time. Please be advised that your request, as submitted, is not perfected. It does not reasonably describe the records sought, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Please note that, pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.5, FOIA requests must describe the documents requested in sufficient detail to allow the FOIA Office to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Additionally, the FOIA does not require agencies to create records in response to FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached out to our National Water Safety Program Manager, who will need additional information in order to search for documents. Please note that Bobber has been the USACE National Water Safety Mascot for several years and is used agency\u2011wide, so it would be impossible to provide the number of times Bobber has been mentioned and/or featured in USACE materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specificity would be helpful. (1) Are you willing to narrow the scope of your request to include specific USACE districts or locations? (2) You provide a very broad list of categories for the types of documents and records you seek; however, what documents or records are most relevant to the information you need for your specific purpose? (3) Please provide a specific timeframe?\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this message by narrowing the scope of your request to more reasonably describe the records you seek. Any details you can provide will be helpful.\r\n\r\nYour request file will remain open for 10 business days while we await your response. If no response is received by February 2, 2022, we will assume you are no longer interested and will close your request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMary Alice Smith\r\nParalegal Specialist\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\r\nHECSA - Office of Counsel\r\n7701 Telegraph Road\r\nAlexandria, VA  22315\r\n703-428-8160 (office)\r\n703-428-7221 (fax)\r\nMary.A.Smith@usace.army.mil\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION -ATTORNEY-CLIENT/ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT.

Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n(3) When and how were the other characters in what I'm going to call the \"Bobber Extended Universe\" created? (e.g. Ranger Buck, Ranger Jane, Ranger Toro, Tackle, Jacques Catsto, Corkey, Sinker)\r\n(4) Were any Bobber-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g trading cards, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n(5) Were there any life-size Bobber costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n(6) Did anyone in Congress ever object to USCA's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is sufficient information to enable your search.\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Belle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller serves as the chief accounting officer and auditor for the City and County of San Francisco. The Controller's Office is responsible for governance and conduct of key aspects of the City's financial operations, including operating the City's financial systems and issuing its financial procedures, maintaining the City's internal control environment, processing payroll for City employees, managing the City's bonds and debt portfolio, and processing and monitoring the City's budget. The department audits and produces regular reports on the City's financial and economic condition and the operations and performance of City government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Public Records Act requires an agency to make available to any person a copy of an, \u201cidentifiable record or records\u201d in its possession (California Government Code \u00a77922.530(a) (formerly \u00a76253(b)).) The City\u2019s obligation under the Sunshine Ordinance, like the California Public Records Act, is to produce public records in its custody (San Francisco Administration Code \u00a767.20(b).) There is no requirement that a department or officer construct a document to meet the specifications of the request. Your request is so open-ended and all-encompassing that it must be narrowed to meet this identifiability standard. The Controller's Office is available to assist you in formulating a request that meets that standard. Please feel free to contact us for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also find links below to online tools including SFOpenBook, DataSF and SFController Reports, where the Public has 24/7 access to City budget, financial, supplier and operating data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* SFOpenBook -\u00a0https://openbook.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* DataSF -\u00a0https://datasf.org\r\n\r\n* SFController -\u00a0Reports Search\r\n\r\n* CCSF\u2019s Public Records Requests -\u00a0https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com\r\n\r\n* CCSF Index to Records -\u00a0https://index.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* CCSF Board of Supervisors Legislation &amp; Related Reporting -\u00a0https://sfgov.legistar.com/Legislation.aspx\r\n\r\n* San Francisco Sales Tax Map\u00a0-\u00a0http://sfstax.hdlgov.com/geodata/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Controller\r\n\r\nCity and County of San Francisco\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City and County of San Francisco.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing SummerCon AKA CyberView, one of the oldest\r\n    hacker conventions, and the longest running such conference in the US.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Data practices law requires entities to allow viewing of data records when they are in a format that does not exist in a different format. Under Minnesota law, and most other states that I\u2019m aware of, the responding entity is not required to create additional reports or new formats to produce data that it has provided or is already providing. Historically, requestors would have to come into the office to view certain records, in this case we are providing it in an online format. If you want to access the individual disciplinary records or training records, you may download them from the public portal.\r\n\r\nAgain, in this case, between the two formats, you are receiving all of the data requested and POST is under no obligation to produce the same data in a different format. The entity providing the data is not under any obligation to create a method or configure software to produce the data already provided. We expended significant expense to create an API to display the data in the public portal.\r\n\r\nErik Misselt - Executive Director\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D96091.1D3D6EB0]\r\nBoard of Peace Officer Standards and Training\r\n1600 University Avenue, Suite 200, Saint Paul, MN 55104\r\nMain: (651) 643-3060  |  www.post.state.mn.us<http://www.post.state.mn.us>\r\nDirect # 651-201-7789\r\nerik.misselt@state.mn.us<mailto:erik.misselt@state.mn.us>\r\n\r\nNOTICE: The information contained in (and attached to) this e-mail is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the designated recipient(s) named above.

Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

Imperial Tobacco PLC, between January 1, 2020 and present.\"  Based on what you have requested, I have to run email searches separate from the OSH inspection information because emails are maintained in a separate system. Due to the sensitive nature of emails, I am the only authorized person within the agency with all email access who may run such a search.\r\nTo date, I have attempted to run the requested company names in a myriad of ways, but because of the commonality of several words  (e.g., alliance, brands, tobacco) and your request for \"all of the agency's email correspondence\" (no specific NC Dept of Labor employee), I am getting thousands of emails that include those words; further, the search must be run through all 350+ NCDOL employees, so each search is taking several hours to run.  I then have to review the emails to see if the email is applicable to your request, such as only referring to \"Alliance One International\" instead of some other Alliance One reference.  I have continued to attempt to refine the searches, in an attempt to produce a more reasonable-sized list. Please be advised that based on my prior attempts, I must advise you that it will  take me extensive time to go through such information.\r\nIs there a way you can refine your request or narrow the time frame?  Are there any specific NCDOL employees that may have been corresponding with these companies or are there specific email addresses within those named companies that I could use to refine the search?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJill F.

I relate this information to you primarily because the terms you indicated (green tobacco illness, heat stress) probably will have little to no connections directly the listed tobacco companies in relation to potential Occupational Safety and Health complaints.\r\n\r\nIn relation to that, growers or Farm Labor Contractors (FLC) would be the more likely employer of workers.  The FLC\u2019s generally recruit and hire seasonal or temporary agricultural laborers; in addition, they may also transport, house, and provide meals for workers.  FLC\u2019s are required to obtain a federal certification: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/mspa/farm-labor-contractors.   Here is an actual US Department of Labor news release: https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210804-0.  Further, H2A workers fare certified under the authority of the US Department of Labor; see this article: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/h2a/final-rule\r\n\r\nPlease also be apprised that NC Department of Labor participates in an advisory capacity to a group that also includes Alliance One International, Inc. The group is the Farm Labor Practices Group (FLPG), which states that it \u201cis a multi-stakeholder initiative, formed in 2012, committed to improving labor practices on farms and thereby enhancing the farmworker\u2019s experience.  The FLPG brings together key voices representing different sectors and perspectives, including growers/farmers, worker advocates, manufacturers and others who sell agricultural products, and government agencies.  The work of the FLPG is facilitated by a third party, the Keystone Policy Center, and includes the following member organizations.\u201d https://farmlaborpracticesgroup.org/about-us/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.keystone.org/our-work/agriculture/farm-labor-practices-group/\r\n\r\n\u2022           Alliance One International, Inc.

In relation to FLPG, she noted that many concerns related to FLCs are outside of the scope of the NC Department of Labor\u2019s statutory authority.  Examples include wage issues (because they fall under USDOL and not NCDOL), contractual violations, visa fraud, recruitment concerns, human trafficking (all of which are outside of this agency\u2019s statutory authority). Therefore, there will be multiple emails included related to this group.  If you do NOT want any of these emails, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI created another pdf that I attempted to attach, but it is too large; I will have to recreate it into smaller files.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on March 16, 2023. You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA CSV export of your agency's Email Aliases (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/email/add-another-email-alias-for-a-user?view=o365-worldwide ) including the following parameters for every shared mailbox: \r\n\r\n- Primary SMTP Address \r\n- Name of the alias \r\n- Name of Mailbox \r\n\r\nA simple way to retrieve this is by having a member of IT (such as a System Administrator) run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell (if email is hosted in a Microsoft Exchange environment): \r\n\r\nGet-Mailbox | Select-Object DisplayName,RecipientType,PrimarySmtpAddress, @{Name=\"Aliases\";Expression={$_.EmailAddresses | Where-Object {$_ -clike \"smtp:*\"}}} | Export-Csv ./email_aliases.csv \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \r\nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) certain City issued email addresses.\u00a0 As publicly-available certain City issued email addresses\u00a0would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v.

The request was for records related to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Council on School Health (COSH), including any communications or correspondence between the school district and these organizations, or any other party that may have provided information to the district from these organizations. To help identify responsive records, I requested a search of specific terms.\r\n\r\nAs of today's date, I have not received a response to my FOIL request. Therefore, I am appealing the lack of response and request that you conduct a diligent search for responsive records and provide them to me in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to modify my original request to narrow the affiliated organizations list to remove references to \"pediatric,\" \"child health,\" and \"school health.\" This modification will allow for a more specific and reasonable description of the records being requested.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of the district's obligations under LGS-01 to retain records until any appeal has been resolved. If any records are withheld, please provide an explanation of the legal basis for the withholding.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
