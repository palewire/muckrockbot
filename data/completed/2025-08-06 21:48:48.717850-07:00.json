This is patently false.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fullerton is currently suing me, my compatriot David and the blog Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future directly related to the findings on several of these officers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/city-of-fullerton-is-suing-me-and-this-blog/>\r\n\r\nIn looking at this list I can quite easily name Officers on that list who have disclosable records under SB1421 including but not limited to Kathryn Hamel, Paul Irish, Miguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo, Christopher Wren & Nathan Roesler.\r\n\r\nA sustained finding was found against Hamel and one cannot simply unring that bell as seen in the recent Contra Costa County tentative decision (CASE NAME: RICHMOND POLICE VS. CITY OF RICHMOND <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Contra-Costa-Ruling-Case-MSN19-0169-2020-07-31.pdf>). \r\n\r\nThis FFFF article related to Hamel is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/>\r\n\r\nChristopher Wren had a sustained finding against for dishonesty related to a workplace affair with a subordinate. In IA Case #17-0038 one of the sustained findings against Officer Wren is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201c6. On December 17, 2017, when Lieutenant Cleggett asked you about your whereabouts, you dishonestly stated to Lieutenant Cleggett that you had been on the phone with your wife the entire time and did not notice Lieutenant Cleggett\u2019s text message.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement of dishonesty was directly related to misconduct as outlined in the timeline of Wren\u2019s activities and being in violation of policy. \r\n\r\nLikewise with Christopher Wren, this article is specifically listed in the lawsuit being waged against myself and FFFF:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/what-happened-to-officer-christopher-wren/\r\n\r\nThe idea that the city attorney is unaware of the sustained findings against their officers which are disclosable under SB1421 is laughable when those very stories are being used by the same attorneys as evidence in a lawsuit where the city seeks a prior restraint against myself and FFFF.\r\n\r\nThe blog has likewise published stories on how Paul Irish was terminated for dishonesty;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullertons-veritable-serpico-problem/>\r\n\r\nMiguel \u201cSonny\u201d Siliceo admitted in the plea deal that he both used excessive force and falsified a police report.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/sonnys-admission-guilt/>\r\n\r\nNathan Roesler filed a false report with the City of Placentia which resulted in an innocent man being arrested for a crime that wasn\u2019t committed against Roesler. This was referred to the District Attorney for prosecution.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/ <https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2018/another-possible-cover-up-by-fpd/>\r\n\r\nThese are the cases which are readily and easily pointed out which I believe to be disclosable under SB1421 which calls all of the other officers on the list into question. The City is blatantly lying to you, your organizations and agencies as well as the public and concerned entities about disclosable records despite being in a separate lawsuit over these very violations of SB1421.\r\n\r\nThey are likewise violating the law in regards to the officer whose records are \"PENDING; NOT YET PRODUCED (3)\u201d. The incident in Corbett\u2019s case was from 2016 and Paez\u2019s was in 2017. The timeline has long passed for required production in both of these cases.\r\n\r\nIf you are honestly seeking these records and others from the City of Fullerton you will likely have no recourse but to seek remedies in order to get to the truth. I have already been forced to take this route unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I wish you all the best in your efforts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Ferguson\r\nHost, The Hourly Struggle\r\nWriter, Friends for Fullerton\u2019s Future\r\nConcerned Citizen\n",

        "communication": "Dear SB 1421 requesters and interested parties:\r\nYou have each recently received a mass email communication from an individual with whom the City of Fullerton is currently engaged in civil litigation, Joshua Ferguson.  The email contained inaccuracies about the City's responses to Public Records requests.  The City would like to correct certain information and assure you and other members of the public of its commitment to transparency and compliance with legal requirements for the disclosure of public records, including certain peace officer records recently made public under SB 1421, which is codified at Penal Code section 832.7.  Of course, the City cannot respond as to any specifics about any individual officers referenced, due to privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclosable use of force files:\r\nNot all use of force investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of those files involving uses of force that have resulted in death or \"great bodily injury.\"  Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \"Great bodily injury\" means \"significant or substantial physical injury.\"  Pen. Code section 16600.  Examples of \"great bodily injury\" include: broken bones, People v. Villarreal (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1141; gunshot wounds, People v. Mendias (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 195; and a dog bite, People v. Frazier (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 613, 618.  SB 1421 also mandates the disclosure of investigation files involving a peace officer or custodial officer's discharge of a firearm at a civilian.  See Pen. Code section 832.7(b)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nDisclosable dishonesty files:\r\nNot all dishonesty investigation files are disclosable under SB 1421.  SB 1421 only allows the disclosure of \"sustained finding[s] . . . [of] dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\"  See Cal. Penal Code section 832.7(b)(1)(C) (emphasis added).\r\nThe Legislature intended to provide the public access to cases involving dishonesty, where an officer \"is proven to have planted evidence, committed perjury, or otherwise been dishonest in the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime.\"  Assembly Committee on Public Safety, Analysis of SB 1421 (June 26, 2018).\r\n\r\nIn order for acts of dishonesty to be disclosable under SB 1421, there must also have been a \"sustained\" finding of dishonesty.  A \"sustained finding\" is defined as \"a final determination by an investigating agency, commission, board, hearing officer, or arbitrator, as applicable, following an investigation and opportunity for an administrative appeal pursuant to Sections 3304 and 3304.5 of the Government Code, that the actions of the peace officer or custodial officer were found to violate law or department policy.\"  Pen. Code section 832.8 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIf an officer investigated for the type dishonesty or sexual assault that is disclosable under SB 1421 resigns prior to a sustained finding, his or her file is not disclosable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the email that you received referred to a specific court ruling (Richmond Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Richmond), that ruling was only tentative (not final) and was only the ruling of one Superior Court Judge in Contra Costa County.  The City of Fullerton is located in Orange County, and is not subject to those courts or their rulings.  However, even a ruling in Orange County would not have been determinative, as facts in different cases may lead to different results, and a single judge's opinion is not required to be followed by other judges, until there is some binding opinion of higher courts.  In fact, in City of Richmond, that court found that the employer and an officer could not reverse sustained findings of dishonesty or sexual assault through a negotiated settlement, after the conclusion of a formal hearing process.  In circumstances where a final, formal hearing has not been held, the court acknowledged that there would be no \"sustained findings\" and hence such records are \"not disclosable under SB 1421.\"  (The City of Richmond court also noted that investigations of dishonesty involving subjects not specifically listed in Penal Code section 832.7 are also not disclosable).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the inapplicability of the City of Richmond opinion in Orange County, the City of Fullerton's disclosure of its records under SB 1421 does follow the same principles.\r\n\r\nThe City is committed to providing all records that it is required and permitted to release to the public relating to peace officers.  It has been working hard to review and release all records newly made releasable since the enactment of SB 1421, and will continue to do so. The City has produced 26 SB 1421 files; has partially produced 13 additional SB 1421 files; and has 2 SB 1421 files pending review (one of which awaits resolution of administrative or other proceedings).  The City's SB 1421 productions are available at www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421<http://www.cityoffullerton.com/sb1421>, and a copy of the summary chart detailing the progress of the City's SB 1421 review and production is posted therein.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your requests or the City's production thereto, please contact the City Clerk's Office or the City Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nKimberly Hall Barlow\r\nJones & Mayer\r\n3777 N.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nDear Elijah Pittman, Thank you for speaking with me today. You clarified your request indicating that you are in possession of photos of the vehicle that is the subject of your request-- a DC Department of Transportation vehicle. This letter acknowledges and responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #R012258-070125 to the DC Department of Public Works (DPW).\u00a0You requested the following records: \u201cInformation including but not limited to documents like registration reports, procurement agreements, contracts, about D.C. government owned and operated Rivian vehicle with number \"98 16037\" and Washington, D.C. license plate number \"DC 16037\" used for. I also request documents pertaining to the purchasing and maintenance of Rivian vehicles and any documents containing the number of total Rivian vehicles in the D.C. fleet.\u201d DPW provides municipal services in two distinct program areas: solid waste management and parking enforcement. Both contribute to making District streets and public spaces clean, safe, attractive, and accessible. DPW's Solid Waste Management Administration performs a number of daily operations including trash and recycling collection, sanitation education and enforcement, graffiti removal, public litter can service, fall leaf collection, and street and alley cleaning. DPW's Parking Enforcement Management Administration enforces the District's on-street parking laws. Approximately 200 parking officers monitor 17,000 meters and 3,500 blocks of residential zoned parking. In addition to routine enforcement, the Parking Enforcement Management Administration is charged with booting and towing operations and with removing abandoned and dangerous vehicles from public and private property. Behind the scenes, DPW's Fleet Management Administration supports municipal operations by procuring, fueling, and maintaining thousands of District government vehicles, from sedans to heavy equipment. Some vehicles are managed and maintained independently by certain agencies. Fleet Management also is responsible for purchasing environmentally friendly, alternative-fuel vehicles (AFV) for the city. Please be advised that DPW maintains information partially responsive to your request. Specifically, DPW is aware of fifty-six (56) Rivian vehicles within the District\u2019s fleet. However, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation manages and maintains all the vehicles. Your FOIA requests concerning procurement agreements and contracts should be submitted to the DC Office of Procurement, FOIA Officer Jeremiah Regan, 441 4th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001, email: jeremiah.regan@dc.gov , phone: (202) 727-0252. Your FOIA requests related to vehicle registrations should be sent to DC Department of Motor Vehicles Pamela Washington, Assistant General Counsel, District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles, 95 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20024-3622, phone (202) 729-7113; email: pamela.washington@dc.gov. (mailto:pamela.washington@dc.gov) Your requests related to maintenance should be sent to Nana Bailey-Thomas, Esq., Hearings/FOIA Officer, Office of the General Counsel, at the District Department of Transportation, 250 M Street, S.E., Suite 800, Washington, D.C. 20003; phone: (202) 673-6811; Email: nana.bailey@dc.gov. (mailto:nana.bailey@dc.gov) Therefore, FOIA request #R012258-070125 is . GRANTED IN PART Please note, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope. The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached. The appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor\u2019s Correspondence Unit, FOIA Appeal; 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 316, Washington, D.C. 20004. Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor\u2019s Correspondence Unit at foia.mayor@dc.gov Further, you must forward a copy of all appeal materials to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency or to the agency head if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to follow these administrative steps will delay the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal.

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed your request and determined that, as currently written, it is unduly burdensome beyond the public interest. The CPS FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,774 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Special Assistant to the CEO\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain student and personal email addresses, identities of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school, details pertaining to pending investigatory, predecisional, or attorney client privileged matters, and other student information which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,774 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, reviewing the requested records would require numerous staff hours and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow this request, you may to specify keywords or a subject matter for which you seek records, modify the request to seek a log of emails between Ms. Hernandez and other specified individuals, and/or limit the timeframe of the search. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

The CPS FOIA Office has conducted an e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in the narrowed request, which yielded over 1,400 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Special Assistant to the CEO\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are likely to contain student email addresses, personal email addresses, and identities of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school district within messages sent to Ms. Hernandez at her @cps.edu email address, details pertaining to pending investigatory, predecisional, or attorney client privileged matters, and other student information or collective bargaining information which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the more than 1,400 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, reviewing the requested records would require numerous staff hours and the dedication of staff and/or resources remains unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This request has not been appreciably narrowed and is therefore denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). You have the right to challenge this denial and/or submit a new request. Any new request will be subject to the FOIA. The CPS FOIA Department considers this request closed. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.

This department is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three-business-day period. \u00a7 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n \r\nEstimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within seven business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. We will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within seven business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than seven business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. \r\n \r\nBilling: \r\nThis department will charge fees for copies and research time required for fulfilling records requests at the actual cost of research time. \u00a7 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items.\" Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. \r\n \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. This department will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. \u00a7 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\n \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. \r\n  \n Thank you,  \r\n  \r\n Saint Charles Police Department \r\n1781 Zumbehl Road\r\nSaint Charles, MO 63303 \r\n(636) 940-4619",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/business/media/william-beecher-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing.

        "communication": "Subject: ALPR Audit Reports Review by Chief of Police Schenita Stewart\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request records related to the Evanston Police Department\u2019s (EPD) use of Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) technology. This request is based on a recent communication from Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police regarding state surveillance and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ensure compliance with the Welcoming City Ordinance and protect community trust, I have assigned a dedicated supervisor to oversee all aspects of ALPR usage within EPD. Furthermore, we conduct regular organizational and network audits, which I personally review. EPD also operates under a clear and established policy governing ALPR use, reinforcing both accountability and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Evanston's website page on the \"Welcoming City Ordinance\" (Ordinance 17-O-25):\r\n\r\n\"Key updates to the Ordinance include:\r\n\r\nData Protection: Prohibiting the sharing of city databases or information with federal immigration agencies, or with third parties unless they certify against its use for civil immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nExpanded Safeguards: Clarifying that City officials will not participate in civil immigration enforcement by any agency or personnel, including private contractors. The City will continue to comply with a valid criminal warrant.\r\n\r\nClosing Loopholes: Strengthening policies to eliminate exceptions that previously allowed limited City involvement in immigration enforcement under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nSupport for Immigrants: Codifying practices that assist crime victims in obtaining specific visas and providing immigration resource information through public services like 311.\r\n\r\nSafe Public Buildings: The City is now tasked with developing policies for its public facilities that prioritize limiting immigration enforcement operations on their premises to the fullest extent allowed by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of this statement made by Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police, along with the updates to Evanston's Welcoming City Ordinance, and in accordance with Illinois law (625 ILCS 5/2-130), which prohibits sharing automated license plate reader ALPR data with out-of-state agencies for purposes such as interfering with reproductive health access or enforcing immigration laws, I request full transparency for the following:\r\n\r\n1) Any records showing review or oversight of Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR Organization or Network audit reports by the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart from January 1, 2024, to the present - including emails, memos, meeting notes, audit summaries, annotations, or briefings demonstrating the Stewart\u2019s direct involvement in reviewing audit data.\r\n\r\n2) Any communications between the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart and Evanston Police Department supervisors or Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR administrators regarding network audit findings that raised questions or concerns, including but not limited to:\r\n    a) Access by out-of-state agencies (e.g., AL, FL, IN, KY, MO, NC, TX, etc) \r\n    b) Federal agency involvement (e.g., DHS, HSI, ICE, CBP, etc)\r\n    c) References to abortion or reproductive health care (e.g., abortion, women, woman, pregnant, pp, planned parenthood, etc)\r\n    d) References to immigration enforcement (e.g., immigration, border patrol, 287g, etc)\r\n    e) Search reasons lacking case numbers or specific descriptions (e.g., inv, p, m, zz, training, test, ab501, invest, narcotics, drugs, 123abv, etc)\r\n\r\n3) Any internal protocols or policies that describe the role of the Evanston Police Department\u2019s chief or supervisors in reviewing Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR audits and identifying potentially inappropriate use, particularly regarding compliance with Illinois statutes and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNiles Coalition",

If you have not already done so, you must create a SecureRelease account. This is the only method available to check the status of your pending FOIA request. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.  We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.

The link is provided below. \r\n\r\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/exhibit_09_-_cbp_use_of_force_policy_final_jan_2021.pdf \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150.

The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease notate file number CBP-FO-2025-115221 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

If no central list or database exists, then I request that the equivalent information be provided in the form of copies of the cover sheet or first page of each IG report completed during calendar year 2016.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Nina Wang:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on July 7, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA's FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA's staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"news media\" requester,\r\npursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1 Section 2(b)(4)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  Your fee waiver request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2025-OSEC-08250-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Susan Ruppel at 202-690-5220 or electronically at susan.ruppel@usda.gov<mailto:susan.ruppel@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA.<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Ruppel, Esq.\r\nFOIA Analyst\r\nOffice of Information Affairs (OIA)\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBEF4C.09875A60]\r\nOffice of the General Counsel (OGC)\r\n1400 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC, 20250\r\nP:  202-690-5220\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Portions of the information you seek are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, section 7.5(r) exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/2(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Additionally, guidance provided by 5 ILCS 7(1)(d)(iv) exempts information that would \u201cunavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities of witnesses to traffic crashes, traffic crash reports, and rescue reports shall be provided by agencies of local government, except when disclosure would interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is the recipient of the request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

We understand that you are requesting the following public  information:\u00a0\r\n\"I would like a spreadsheet containing all the academic dishonesty reports from the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester to the end of the Spring 2025 Semester, organized by university college.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn complying with this request, please see the attached document when reviewing this information please consider the custodian's commetns which are provided below.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\"It is important to note that these are reports and do not reflect outcomes. So Arts and Humanities had 38 reports of dishonesty but that does not mean that 38 individuals were found responsible of dishonesty. I am merrily giving you the number of reports that were submitted.\r\nImportant to note that Natural and Social Sciences is the largest college, followed by Arts and Humanities, then School of Business and then School of Education (largest meaning overall enrollment of students). \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information. Academic dishonesty/Misconduct covers a variety of charges (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) based on the request I am just giving anything that falls under the umbrella of academic dishonesty (which is all academic misconduct).\r\n\r\nI have divided the colleges by Current system effective July 1, 2025. The Unknown are cases where allegations of academic misconduct were made but no information about who did it was included in the report. An example is someone in my class was cheating but I don't know who they are the and the report writer didn't include class information. \"\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n I apologize for the delay as I was out sick last week. We try not to charge for quick report information.\u00a0SOU\u00a0now considers this request\u00a0fulfilled, please let me know if you have any questions\u00a0or concerns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHave a beautiful day!",
