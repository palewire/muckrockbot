As such, I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your request for records made pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (the Act).\r\n\r\nAs I am sure you are aware, the Act requires \u201creasonable specificity,\u201d which is outlined in \u00a7 2.2-3704 (B) of the Code of Virginia<https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3704/>. With regard to your request for \u201cany and all communication\u201d, we ask that you please specify what type of \u201ccommunication\u201d you are requesting, such as emails.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please further narrow your request, such as providing specific individuals or groups of individuals and providing a date range, so we can better assess and respond to your records request.\r\n\r\nProviding greater specificity will help us better assess and respond to your records request and most likely help to reduce the number of records and the amount of time that our staff will need to search for, review, and possibly redact portions of these records. This will likely provide you with a cost savings, if applicable.\r\n\r\nUpon your further clarification regarding the additional requested information above, we will work to determine what records exist and are responsive to your request, as well as an estimate of any costs that may be associated with your request.\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Holbrook\r\nCommunications Specialist- FOIA Compliance\r\nHanover County Public Schools\r\nrholbrook@hcps.us",

The suggested way to achieve this is to use an HMAC cryptographic operation. The Python (https://www.python.org) script provided below demonstrates how to represent phone numbers as privacy-preserving unique identifiers via HMAC-SHA256.\r\n    \r\n    To preserve the privacy of callers, the requester specifically requests that if HMAC or a similar cryptographic scheme is used to satisfy this request, that the secret key is NOT disclosed in any response or public records, to the extent permitted by law.\r\n    \r\n\r\nExample Python Script:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n#\r\n# An example showing how to represent a log of phone numbers as\r\n# privacy-preserving unique identifiers using HMAC-SHA256.\r\n#\r\n# Below is the expected example output:\r\n# \r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-07 11:07:55, Status: 2b, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-10 23:59:12, Status: 2c, Source: 4f6dde6cf83ca4311ad66c8f97616682bd08848a383e7b23b032d602e3d7105d\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 13:00:35, Status: 2a, Source: ea558425ccced1be9f084efd9df45ae39343e138494a611a0c28877a9bb86f43\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 20:32:07, Status: 2g, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n#\r\n################################################################################\r\nimport hashlib\r\nimport hmac\r\n\r\n# An example list containing the raw requested information\r\ndata = [\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-07 11:07:55', 'status': '2b', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-10 23:59:12', 'status': '2c', 'caller': '555-555-0001'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 13:00:35', 'status': '2a', 'caller': '555-555-9876'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 20:32:07', 'status': '2g', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n]\r\n\r\n# IMPORTANT: Replace this value with a secret string of random words\r\n# and DO NOT disclose this secret.\r\nsecret = \"willow dog forbearance hiccup nonsense ant index\".encode('UTF-8')\r\n\r\n# Iterate over the raw data record and print it in the requested representation\r\nfor entry in data:\r\n    source = entry['caller'].encode('UTF-8')\r\n    privacy_id = hmac.digest(secret, source, hashlib.sha256).hex()\r\n\r\n    output = 'Timestamp: {:s}, Status: {:s}, Source: {:s}'\r\n    print(output.format(entry['ts'], entry['status'], privacy_id))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe requester of this information is willing to provide pro bono technical education and assistance with respect to this request, in a manner consistent with any specified IT restrictions and limitations.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Victoria:\r\n\r\nI have received this request.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur process is to ask the member(s) to review their records for records which may apply to this request. In addition, we ask the legislature's computer center staff to run a search of the legislative email accounts of the person or persons, if any, to locate any emails in those accounts that are responsive to the request. The computer staff segregates the person's mailboxes, runs the search inquiries using the terms or information you supplied covering the request period and provides those search results to me. The computer searches are run by a joint (House and Senate) computer staff and can only be run one-at-a-time and in the order received. There are currently several Senate searches that pre-date this one for the Senate alone. I do not know how many House of Representatives searches are currently in the queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the computer staff's segregation of emails, and the person\u2019s segregation of records, I then must review the email located within the mailboxes which are identified using the search terms you provided to: (1) remove all non-public records, i.e. e-mails that have nothing to do with conducting the public's business, and (2) identify the emails that are protected speech under our constitutional privilege contained in LA Constitution Art. III, \u00a7 8. After identification of any privileged e-mails, if any, I discuss each privileged record with any person or associated member to ascertain whether that member will waive or assert the privilege on each identified record. If the member asserts this privilege, I must then remove those from the documents from other records that could be produced. This process results in a set of records which is then made available for inspection and copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate charges $0.25 per page for copies plus the cost of shipping. The charge applies whether records are reproduced and mailed, downloaded, or emailed (minus the cost of mailing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYolanda Dixon\r\nSecretary of the Senate\r\n225-342-6184\r\ndixony@legis.la.gov",
