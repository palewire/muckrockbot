        "communication": "Dear Rob Vernier: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P044338-101123.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

I am interested in learning more about the agency's use of the VeriWatch device, including how it is being used, how much it costs, and what safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of individuals who are subject to its use. Specifically, I am interested in any records that discuss:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the agency's contract with BI Incorporated.\r\nThe terms of the contract, including the cost of the VeriWatch devices and the duration of the contract.\r\nHow the agency is using the VeriWatch devices.\r\nThe types of data that the VeriWatch devices collect and how that data is used.\r\nThe safeguards that the agency has in place to protect the privacy of individuals who are subject to the use of the VeriWatch devices.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with copies of all responsive records within 30 days of receiving this request. If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at mdegeurin@gizmodo.com. I am a tech policy reporter at Gizmodo where I have experience reporting on policing technology. I believe these records are in the public interest and I plan to write about them for our large audience of readers. As such, I would like to respectfully request to have fees for these documents waived. If you have any questions about my media status, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMack DeGeurin",
