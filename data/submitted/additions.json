All records concerning the individual with the date of birth listed above should be considered responsive. \r\n\r\nMr. Kissinger is deceased. Please find proof of death attached. Privacy interests for dead persons are diminished. Records should be released in the overwhelming public interest as Kissinger was a highly influential diplomat, political scientist and geopolitical consultant who served as United States secretary of state and national security advisor under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",
