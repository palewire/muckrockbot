        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records for contract N6onr-23212 NR 170 698, awarded to the Research Center for Group Dynamics (RCGD) at the Institute of Social Research within the University of Michigan between the years 1947 and 1950. The contact funded social science research undertaken by Dr. Leon Festinger, Dr. Kurt Back, Dr. Stanley Schachter, Dr. Harold H. Kelley, and Dr. John Thibau, and is identified publicly in a book compiling their observations, published by the University of Michigan in 1952 under the title \"Theory and Experiment in Social Communication\". I am attaching two pages from the book in PDF format as verification of the contract details and funding agency.\r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandums of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the nature of the social science research the United States funded during the Cold War; additionally, Dr. Festinger has been a recurring subject of public interest over the last 75 years, as his work on cognitive dissonance is cited to this day in academia and by the media to explain extremism and political polarization, and any contributions or assistance provided by the government would likely alter public understanding of that work and its application in the fields of psychology and communication research.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

It would require the City of Cambridge to search an unknown time period for communications of all types.  It would also require that the City search all of the accounts and contact all staff members in each of the Departments listed below.  Because no date range has been provided, and because staffing in City Departments changes regularly, the City would be required to expend time determining the names of staff who have left the City to discover whether they might have responsive records.  Your request further does not provide sufficient information regarding the Companies and Agencies with whom the City may have communicated regarding the requested topics.  No individual names, email addresses, or domain names have been provided which might allow for searching for responsive communications.  Finally, I ask that you provide more information regarding the topic of the request, and if possible, narrow it to the type of communications you seek on this matter.\r\n\r\nTo assist in narrowing your request so that it may be possible to perform a search, the following information is necessary:\r\n\r\n\u2022             A time frame for this request;\r\n\u2022             The nature of the communications (email, hardcopy, etc);\r\n\u2022             The names of individual City of Cambridge staff whose accounts should be included in this search, or who you believe may have communications with these parties;\r\n\u2022             The names, and preferably the email addresses of each party at the named agencies or companies whose communications you seek.  If an email address is not possible, please provide the domain names from which such communications would likely have been sent.\r\n\u2022             Keywords to be used in the search.  The more specific or unique a keyword, the more likely the search will locate the correct results.  Unfortunately, words such as \u201croad connection\u201d are often used frequently in the Departments you have listed below.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSeah Levy\r\nPublic Records Access Officer\r\nCity of Cambridge, Law Department\r\nCity Hall, 795 Massachusetts Avenue\r\nCambridge, MA 02139\r\n(617) 349-4121 | Fax: (617) 349-4134\r\npublicrecords@cambridgema.gov<mailto:publicrecords@cambridgema.gov>\n",
