I am writing to request expedited processing of my FOIL request (Tracking #W020119-090323) submitted on September 3, 2023, regarding the incident on the 400 block of South Pearl Street on September 1, 2023.\r\n\r\nGiven the ongoing state disaster emergency declared by Governor Kathy Hochul concerning gun violence (Executive Order No. 3.20), the information sought in my FOIL request is of significant public interest and concern. The Governor's emergency declaration underscores the urgency and importance of transparency in matters related to gun violence.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that the processing of my FOIL request be expedited and that a rolling release of records be implemented, given the public safety implications.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2022. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2022.\r\nB5. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2023 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB6. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2023 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry.  The Medical Examiner\u2019s Office (MEO) does not officially track Ventura County\u2019s homeless deaths.  We have record of homeless deaths only known to the MEO.   I must reiterate, these are the \u201cknown\u201d deaths to the MEO, this is not exhaustive of all county deaths.  For all homeless Ventura County deaths, you need to contact the county epidemiologist at the office of Vital Stats at Ventura County Public Health.  The known deaths from the MEO are those that are reported to us.  The MEO only accepts cases that fall under our jurisdiction.   This is approximately one third of all county deaths.  There are many cases that our office declines if the death occurred in the hospital under medical care after 24 hours of care and of natural causes.  Thus, there are undoubtedly deaths of unsheltered people who fall under these criteria.  Please contact the office of Vital Stats or the California Dept. of Public Health to retrieve the data you need.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nVentura County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office\r\n\r\n3100 Foothill Road\r\n\r\nVentura, CA  93003\r\n\r\n(805) 641-4400 T  |  (805) 641-4410 F  |  L#4550\r\n\r\nmeoadmin@ventura.org<mailto:meoadmin@ventura.org>  |  https://meo.ventura.org<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/meo.ventura.org/__;!!AvL6XA!1VUEZHcbjNWEaD86D9AFH8qk9IFOct_16ZnKm7sT2vAYAR-o-6dbHfLfLjcgsTngcYVrwy-LYt69erBU3aL_8goYHTEvMDrL8bD5$>\n[cid:image001.png@01D9DCEF.5DD25460]",
