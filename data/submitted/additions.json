If the Department maintains this information in an Excel spreadsheet, I request that the record be produced in this format. If datasets, logs or lists are not available, please provide all available agreements with agencies that have access to the FRS, including all Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or other agreements with federal, state or local law enforcement agencies. \r\n\r\n2. Any datasets, logs, or lists showing which agencies requested access and which agencies received access to the FRS from January 1, 2020 to the date of the most recently available data. Please provide all data and records of queries and requests for face recognition comparisons, including, as available, the requesting organization, the number of requests made, and the number of requests granted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
