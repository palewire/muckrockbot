If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nFurther, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest.

All requests for public records will be governed by the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1, and you may be receiving a redacted version of the requested records. IMPORTANT INFORMATION - if you requested footage of an encounter captured on an OFFICER WORN BODY CAMERA, the following applies. \nThe Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act (50 ILCS 706/10-20) provides that recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, unless certain exceptions dictate otherwise.

Generally, if the footage is not flagged, footage is only subject to release under FOIA to the extent that the subject of the footage or that subject\u2019s attorney is the recipient. \nIf the requested footage falls into one of the exceptions above and is subject to FOIA as permitted by the Body Worn Camera Act, you must demonstrate that you are an authorized recipient. If you are making a request as the subject of a record, please provide photo identification. \nIf you are making a request on behalf of the subject of a public record, provide identification of the subject and a signed authorization sufficient to show that you are entitled to receive the same information as the subject. \n PHOTO IDENTIFICATI ON\u00a0is likely REQUIRED in order to identify you as the subject of the encounter with law enforcement who is seen on the body camera footage. \n \nUpon receipt of all required materials (photo ID, authorization, or fee, for example), your request will be processed in five (5) business days.\u00a0 If you would not otherwise be entitled to the requested record and have not provided the necessary materials in order to process the request, it will be denied following five (5) business days. \nPlease login to \"My Request Center\" to update your account information, track the status of your request and receive requested records when they become available. \n This is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account.
