        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Vermont Public Records Act. I am seeking a roster of all sworn law enforcement officers currently at the Vermont Criminal Justice Council. This could include instructors at the academy, but also any other officers employed at the agency. I am interested in both full- and part-time officers, as well as both corrections and traditional officers.\r\n\r\nFor each officer, I am seeking the following information:\r\n- Name and ID/badge number (if applicable)\r\n- Rank and/or job title\r\n- Start date\r\n- Gender, race/ethnicity, and year of birth\r\n- 2022 salary and overtime pay\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to provide the data in a machine-readable form, such as CSV, Excel, SQL database, etc, that is strongly preferred and greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBrian Waters",
