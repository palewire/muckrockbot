Before we can proceed, we need some additional clarification.\r\n\r\nThere are no responsive records to the following data points, as requested:\r\n\r\n  *   DELC does not collect, monitor, or track any data on license exempt providers, unless they are a recorded program.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track enrollment.\r\n  *   DELC does monitor some provider types (center-based or home-based), but we do not monitor or track other specific program/service types.\r\n  *   DELC monitors a provider\u2019s acceptance of subsidies only if they are a current participant, so there is no historical data available.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track previous QRIS ratings, only the current QRIS rating of an active/most recent awarding.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor the price of services offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are currently unable to determine if there is historical data for the following:\r\n\r\n  *   Hours of operation.\r\n  *   Ages served.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Oregon Revised Statues ORS 192.365, your request does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest requires disclosure of the requested information for RF and CF facilities in this particular instance. Therefore, we are only able to share the following information:\r\n\r\n     *   Active RF and CF facilities: Facility name and facility city/state/zip.\r\n     *   Active CC facilities: Facility name, full facility address (street and number, city/state/zip).\r\n\r\nThe request for violation records spanning \u201cas far back as the data systems allow\u201d is denied. The request is too broad, and the information is available on our Child Safety Portal, as found here: Find Child Care Oregon - Find Child Care Oregon<https://findchildcareoregon.org/>\r\n\r\nOregon Revised Statues Referenced:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   ORS 192.365: Child care facility operator and exempt family child care provider information (residential address and telephone numbers, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, Social Security numbers, employer-issued identification card numbers, and emergency contact information)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with a quote for the portions of your request that are available, please let me know by responding to this email.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n[A picture containing graphics, cartoon  Description automatically generated]\r\nMadison Buck (She/Her)\u200b\r\nDepartment of Early Learning and Care\u200b\r\nPublic Records and Communication Specialist\r\nDELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov<mailto:DELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov>\r\nWebsite: Oregon.gov/DELC<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4T6sCW6qNgs52KYX8Ix6GqA?domain=oregon.gov>\u200b\r\nConnect with DELC: Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/OREarlyLearning/> | Instagram<https://www.instagram.com/OREarlyLearning/> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/@OREarlyLearning> | LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/OREarlyLearning/>\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Department of Early Learning and Care (DELC) fosters coordinated, culturally appropriate, and family-centered services that recognize and respect the strengths of children, families and early learning and care professionals.

We can provide what we have, but it would not be completely representative. If you would like to adjust your request to encompass a smaller time period of data, that would adjust the quote as seen below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with ORS 192.324(4)(a), the public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public body\u2019s actual cost of making public records available, including costs for summarizing, compiling or tailoring the public records, either in organization or media, to meet the request.\r\n\r\nThe estimate to produce the requested records is as follows (subject to change):\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nHours\r\nHourly Rate\r\nSubtotal\r\nPull and organize records\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nReview and redaction for exempt material\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Estimated clerical time\r\n2.0 hours, with the first 30 minutes waived\r\n1.5\r\n$37.50\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Cost\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\nDELC requires 50% of the total cost to begin work on this request, which would be $18.75.\r\n\r\nWe will update this estimate with the actual time it takes to process this request, and the remainder of the cost will be due prior to delivery.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the actual cost exceeds this estimate, we will contact you for approval to proceed with additional work. Please confirm if you wish to proceed with this request as written, refine your request to reduce the fee, or withdraw your request in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to proceed, please reply to this email and we will send an invoice and payment instructions.

Provide a list or records regarding all grievance settlements including settlement amounts, union, date grievance filed, school (if applicable), date grievance settled, and contract issues of grievance from July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The District is prohibited by law from releasing employee performance evaluation information in accordance with 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1, which prohibits the release of teacher, principal and superintendent performance evaluations, as well as 820 ILCS 40/11, which prohibits the release of performance evaluations for public employees. \r\n2. Provide a list or records regarding all grievances in arbitration including union, date grievance filed, date arbitration started, school (if applicable) and contract issues of grievance from July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. \r\nRESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records.\u00a0The records provided include all grievances received by the Labor & Employee Discipline Unit only. Additionally, be advised that the CPS FOIA office determined that this portion of your request is categorical in nature as it does not reasonably identify a document for search, and the collection of this information would require the District to create records. Specifically, the CPS does not comprehensively track the requested information in the manner requested, in the normal course of business. As such fulfilling this request would be considered creating records which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, in order to comply with your request, each and every file would have to be pulled and all the portions of information you have requested would have to be searched for. Essentially, a new record would have to be created. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions or prepare researched records in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. 3. Provide a total list of all grievances filed including union, date grievance filed, school (if applicable) and contract issues of grievance from July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records.\u00a0The records provided include all grievances received by the Office of Administrative Hearings only. As to the remainder of all other potentially responsive data, the CPS FOIA office has determined that it is categorical in nature as it does not reasonably identify a document for search, and the collection of this information would require the District to create records. Specifically, the CPS does not comprehensively track the requested information in the manner requested, in the normal course of business. As such fulfilling this request would be considered creating records which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, in order to comply with your request, each and every file would have to be pulled and all the portions of information you have requested would have to be searched for. Essentially, a new record would have to be created. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982).

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Charles Leo Daniel, who died in ICE Custody March 7, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrDanielCharlesLeo.pdf.. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.

Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Colon",

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I am requesting access to the list of Twitter profiles blocked by the Ossining Police Department's official Twitter account (@OssiningPolice).\r\n\r\nTo assist you in locating these records, please follow the steps below to view the blocked profiles:\r\n\r\nLog into the @OssiningPolice Twitter account.\r\nClick on 'More' in the menu on the left-hand side.\r\nClick on 'Settings and privacy'.\r\nSelect 'Privacy and safety'.\r\nScroll down to 'Safety' and click on 'Blocked accounts'. Here, you will find the list of all blocked profiles.\r\nGiven that these records relate to a public department's social media, which is utilized for communication with and among the public, they should fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to two cases related to social media blocking and the First Amendment. The first is Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump (2017), where the court found that blocking users from an official's Twitter account, which is used as a public forum, is a violation of their First Amendment rights. The second is Davison v. Randall (2019), where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended this reasoning to local officials.\r\n\r\nWhile these cases deal with blocking individuals on Twitter, they provide the legal context under which public officials and departments must operate when considering whether to block individuals from their social media accounts.\r\n\r\nGiven these precedents, the block list of the Ossining Police Department's Twitter account should constitute disclosable public records under the FOIA as they pertain to potential infringements on First Amendment activity.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). I also redacted certain information which could reveal the identities of undercover police officers or informants.\u00a0This information is exempt from the Inspection of Public Records Act.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). If made public, the redacted information would seriously interfere with the effectiveness of criminal investigations and prosecutions, and endanger undercover police officers or informants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive Records:\r\n\r\n* Reports (Invoiced)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe responsive records are available for purchase, please see the invoice that was released to you for the price and mailing address; once we receive payment, we will mail the records to you; you may also come into our office to pay for and pick up the records with exact cash or check/money order. If you are seeking to inspect the responsive records free of charge, the inspection will take place at the City Clerk's Office, located at 600 2nd\u00a0Street NW, 7th Floor, Albuquerque, NM 87102, Monday- Friday from 8am- 4:30pm.

Leonard, Sr. (1982-1959).\r\nYour request was received in this office, Archives II Textual Reference, on\r\nthe date of March 24, 2025 and assigned FOIA case number 25-38773.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library\r\n<https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/> may contain records relating to\r\nPresident Eisenhower\u2019s Inauguration Ball, so we have cc\u2019d them above and\r\nthey will provide a separate response.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the National Archives is the repository for the\r\npermanently valuable non-current records of the Federal Government.\r\nAlthough only 1-3% of the records created by the Federal Government are\r\ntransferred to the National Archives, our holdings consist of hundreds of\r\nmillions of records, the vast majority of which are not name-searchable.\r\nYou will need to begin your research by determining the agency with which\r\nyour subject interacted and exactly what types of records you wish to see.\r\n\r\nWe also suggest that you request a copy of his Official Military Personnel\r\nFile (OMPF)\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/about-service-records-0>.\r\nOMPFs and individual medical reports for individuals who served with the\r\nU.S. Army who were separated from the service after October 1912 and before\r\n1960 are in the custody of NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)\r\nin St. Louis. In many cases where personnel records were destroyed in the 1973\r\nfire <https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/fire-1973>, proof\r\nof service can be provided from other records such as morning reports,\r\npayrolls, and military orders, and a certificate of military service will\r\nbe issued. Please complete a GSA Standard Form 180\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/files/research/order/standard-form-180.pdf> and\r\nmail it to NARA's National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel\r\nRecords), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. Veterans and next of\r\nkin of deceased veterans also may use eVetRecs to request records. See eVetRecs\r\nHelp\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/evetrecs-help.html>\r\nfor instructions. If there is any information requested by the form that\r\nyou do not know, you may omit it or provide estimates (such as for dates),\r\nbut the more information you provide, the easier it will be to locate the\r\ncorrect file if it survived the fire. For more information see Official\r\nMilitary Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/military-personnel/ompf-archival-requests>\r\n.\r\n\r\nArchival OMPFs may also be requested by visiting the Archival Research Room\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/research-room> at the National Archives\r\nat St. Louis <https://www.archives.gov/st-louis>.

Would you mind please taking another look and share with us any of that language doesn't fall under a specific exemption? If it does all fall under an exemption, could you please let me know which one? \r\n\r\nMany thanks again for your work on this. \r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nJessica\r\n                ",

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Please let me know when I can expect to receive a response. This communication was originally to greg.hebert@oxnardpd.org. Please see the following request. \r\n---\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords of your agency related to the deployment and use of controlled equipment obtained through the 1033 Program of the Department of Defense, as set forth below.\r\n\r\nAccording to records posted by the Defense Logistics Agency (https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/), your agency acquired controlled equipment through the 1033 program, including firearms, as reflected in the attached spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nI. Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Please let me know when I can expect to receive a response. This communication was originally to greg.hebert@oxnardpd.org. Please see the following request.\r\n---\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords of your agency related to the deployment and use of controlled equipment obtained through the 1033 Program of the Department of Defense, as set forth below.\r\n\r\nAccording to records posted by the Defense Logistics Agency (https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/), your agency acquired controlled equipment through the 1033 program, including firearms, as reflected in the attached spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nI.

Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Bodycam footage reportedly captures officers encouraging Nino\u2019s father to physically discipline him, dismissing allegations of abuse, and making statements such as \"Your dad should beat you\" and \"You have no rights.\" A confrontation ensued when Officer Willer attempted to take Nino\u2019s phone, resulting in officers using force against him. Nino suffered a broken wrist, facial lacerations requiring stitches, and was subsequently hospitalized. He was charged with aggravated assault, though charges were later dropped.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nSpoke with Sergio Nino\u2019s father before engaging with the teenager.\r\nInteracted with Sergio Nino, including advising his father on discipline.\r\nUsed force on Nino, leading to his injuries and subsequent arrest.\r\nTransported Nino from the scene to medical facilities or booking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHarun",

Your request was received by this office on February 19, 2025, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-1282-F. You requested the following: \n1. The current org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office, reflecting vacancies as of February 18, 2025.2. The org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office on January 18, 2025, reflecting any vacancies on that date. \nYour request for expedited processing has been denied because you have not demonstrated that you meet the threshold requirement of being a person primarily engaged in disseminating information. Please note that due to current resource limitations we are experiencing prolonged delays in the processing of requests as we are working through a backlog. \nIf you are not satisfied with OPM\u2019s determination, you may administratively appeal in writing by email to OGCAtty@opm.gov.\u00a0An appeal should include a copy of the initial request, a copy of this email denying your request for expedited processing, and a statement explaining why you believe the decision is wrong. Appeals must be electronically transmitted within 90 calendar days of the date of this email. \nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS by e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or by mail at: \nOffice of Government Information Services \nNational Archives and Records Administration \n8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS \nCollege Park, Maryland 20740-6001 \nWe appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
