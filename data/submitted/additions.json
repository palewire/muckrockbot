IHSC's preliminary mortality review. \r\n2. GEO's Significant Event Notification or Significant Incident Report regarding the subject's death in custody. \r\n3. ICE Public Affairs communications regarding the announcement of this death. \r\n4. Communications and attachments thereto regarding the detainee death review, mortality review, and healthcare and security compliance analysis. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and hereby declare and certify under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination via edited publications. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; https://atlpresscollective.com/author/free/. \r\n2. There is an urgent need to inform the public of the conditions that produced this subject's death. ICE has invested a substantial portion of its detention funds in the facilities and services provided by The GEO Group. Systems failures within GEO facilities stand to impact tens of thousands of noncitizens who will be incarcerated by ICE in those spaces. \r\n3. Deaths and other harms in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread media attention about which there is substantial evidence that government oversight of its contractors is sorely lacking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
