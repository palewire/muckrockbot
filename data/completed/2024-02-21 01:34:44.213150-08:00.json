I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJeane Duane Kirkpatrick (November 19, 1926 \u2013 December 7, 2006) was an American diplomat and political scientist. An ardent anticommunist, she was a longtime Democrat who became a Republican in 1985. After serving as Ronald Reagan's foreign policy adviser in his 1980 campaign, she became the first woman to serve as US Ambassador to the United Nations. She was known for the \"Kirkpatrick Doctrine\", which advocated supporting authoritarian regimes around the world if they went along with Washington's aims. She believed that they could be led into democracy by example. She wrote, \"Traditional authoritarian governments are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.\" Kirkpatrick served on Reagan's Cabinet on the National Security Council, Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Defense Policy Review Board, and chaired the Secretary of Defense Commission on Fail Safe and Risk reduction of the Nuclear Command and Control System. \r\n\r\nHer death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/washington/09kirkpatrick.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names and companies.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the Bureau for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

After careful review, your request has been granted in part, denied in part.  We have redacted social security numbers, birthdates, personal addresses, telephone numbers, emails, and other personal information.  Pursuant to MCL 15.243 Sec. 13 (1)(a), this information is exempt from disclosure as it is \u201cof a personal nature and disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d All other requested information is enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal the items denied to the City Council in writing.  Such writing must specifically state the word \u201cAPPEAL\u201d and indicate the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial or seek judicial review in the Saginaw County Circuit Court within 180 days of the final determination to deny a request.  If the Council or Court determines a public record is not exempt from disclosure, it shall order its release or production.  If a Court determines that the City has been arbitrary and capricious in not disclosing a public record, it may award in addition to actual, compensatory, and punitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total cost associated with responding to your request is $0.00.  You may find a copy of the City's FOIA policy and public summary on the City of Saginaw website at\r\nhttps://cms5.revize.com/revize/cityofsaginawmi/Documents%20Center/Government/City%20Manager/Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act/FOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fcms5.revize.com%2frevize%2fcityofsaginawmi%2fDocuments%2520Center%2fGovernment%2fCity%2520Manager%2fFreedom%2520of%2520Information%2520Act%2fFOIA-Policy-Appendix.pdf&c=E,1,S-Z6iIVgvjdI-LSUZPi4IQrxiHHjkRiAhnWGllp-BSxWfpy-_gyv_T-B7cjzqXx4UxT4X-MAPDvUyYdlK3Wgw1BXjk5-Rf0I9N3rx91Pt5XL&typo=1>.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (989) 759-1403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVicki L.

A DRRTP provides a residential level of care for Veteran populations including medical, psychiatric, SUD, PTSD, and homelessness.

However, based on some of the web search results I found, it seems that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries, unless there is a clear causal link between the two\u00b2. For example, in Minnesota, a mental injury that results from a physical injury (such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) may be compensable, but a mental injury that does not have a physical component (such as emotional distress or anxiety) may not be\u2074. Similarly, in product liability cases, courts have been more likely to award damages for mental anguish if the plaintiff suffered a physical injury or was exposed to a substantial risk of physical harm by the defective product\u00b2. Therefore, it seems that courts have generally favored a more objective and tangible approach to assessing damages, rather than a subjective and intangible one. However, this may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, as well as the applicable law and precedent.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Damages & Compensation for Mental Anguish in a Personal Injury ... - AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/damages-compensation-mental-aguish.html.\r\n(2) Mental vs. Physical Work Injuries (How Do They Differ?). https://mottazsiskinjurylaw.com/physical-vs-mental-work-injury/.\r\n(3) Damages and Compensation in a Personal Injury Lawsuit | AllLaw. https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html.\r\n(4) Bodily Injury vs Personal Injury (Differences Explained). https://www.schmidtandclark.com/bodily-injury-vs-personal-injury.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \u201cThen-Chief Judge Howell recently used an \"objective metric\"-Veterans Affairs disability ratings-to guide her in departing from the Heiser awards. See Schooley v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 17-cv-1376, 2019 WL 2717888, at ~7475 (D.D.C. June 27, 2019). VA disability ratings are \"a specialized agency s official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\" Id. at 74 ( cleaned up). Because VA ratings roll mental and physical injuries into one number, they facilitate a more objective approach to awarding damages. This is so because courts need not weigh whether certain injuries merit more money than others. See id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for your message. It seems that you are interested in the use of VA disability ratings as a way of determining damages for mental and physical injuries in cases involving terrorism. Based on the web search results I found, VA disability ratings are a system that evaluates the degree of disability caused by service-connected conditions for veterans. The ratings range from 0% to 100%, and they affect the amount of monthly compensation and other benefits that veterans receive\u00b9\u00b2. VA disability ratings are based on the evidence submitted by the veterans or obtained from military records, and they may include a VA medical examination in some cases\u00b2.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using VA disability ratings as an objective metric for awarding damages is that they provide a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the veterans' ability to function and earn income. They also avoid the need for courts to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify\u00b3. Furthermore, VA disability ratings reflect the official determination of a specialized agency that has expertise and experience in dealing with service-related disabilities\u2074.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may also be some limitations and challenges in applying VA disability ratings to non-veterans or to injuries that are not service-connected. For example, VA disability ratings may not capture the full extent of the pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of enjoyment of life that victims of terrorism may experience. They may also not account for the differences in individual circumstances, such as age, education, occupation, or family situation, that may affect the severity and duration of the injuries. Additionally, VA disability ratings may not be available or reliable for some victims, especially those who are not U.S. citizens or residents, or those who have not sought or received medical treatment or diagnosis for their injuries\u2074.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while VA disability ratings may offer a useful and objective tool for assessing damages for mental and physical injuries in some cases, they may not be sufficient or appropriate for all cases. Courts may need to consider other factors and sources of evidence, such as expert testimony, medical records, personal statements, or witness accounts, to determine the fair and reasonable amount of compensation for each victim\u2074.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) 2023 Veterans Disability Compensation Rates | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/.\r\n(2) About VA Disability Ratings | Veterans Affairs. https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/.\r\n(3) VACI's 2023 VA Disability Calculator - VA Claims Insider. https://vaclaimsinsider.com/va-disability-rating-calculator/.\r\n(4) Veterans\u2019 Benefits Rating and Rates | ChooseVA. https://choose.va.gov/disability/ratings-and-rates.\r\n(5) VA Math - How Combined VA Disability Ratings Are Calculated. https://themilitarywallet.com/va-math-combined-disability-ratings/.\u201d\r\n\r\n6. \u201cgiven \"that in general, courts have been more reluctant to award damages for mental injuries than for physical injuries\" could it be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is incredibly significant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is an interesting question. I am not a legal expert, but based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b9 awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, it shows that the court recognized the severity and impact of the mental injuries suffered by the plaintiffs, who were victims of a terrorist attack, and did not discount or diminish their claims based on the lack of physical injuries or evidence. The court stated that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are no less real than their physical injuries, and no less deserving of compensation.\\\"\u00b9 The court also noted that \\\"[t]he plaintiffs' mental injuries are not merely transient or fleeting, but rather chronic and enduring, affecting their daily lives and relationships for years after the attack.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nSecond, it shows that the court applied an objective metric, namely the VA disability ratings, to determine the relative degree of injury suffered by each service-member plaintiff. The court explained that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating is a specialized agency's official determination regarding the extent of disabling injury sustained by service members in connection with military service.\\\"\u00b9 The court also stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating provides a consistent and standardized way of measuring the impact of injuries on the plaintiffs' ability to function and earn income.\\\"\u00b9 The court further stated that \\\"[t]he VA disability rating avoids the need for this Court to compare and weigh different types of injuries, such as mental and physical ones, which may be subjective and difficult to quantify.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nThird, it shows that the court followed the precedent set by other cases involving victims of terrorism, such as Akins v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00b2, where the court also awarded damages based on the VA disability ratings. The court in Schooley cited Akins as an example of a case where \\\"the plaintiffs' mental injuries were compensable even though they did not suffer any physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attack.\\\"\u00b9 The court in Schooley also noted that \\\"[t]he use of VA disability ratings as a measure of damages is consistent with other cases in this district involving victims of terrorism.\\\"\u00b9\r\n\r\nTherefore, it could be argued that the findings in Schooley v. Islamic Republic of Iran awarding the same amount for mental and physical injury is significant because it demonstrates the court's recognition, objectivity, and consistency in compensating victims of terrorism for their mental and physical injuries.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) Schooley v.

The handbook establishes workplace policies, procedures and protocols for creating and implementing guidance for all VA programs and activities consistent with the changes to the Rehabilitation Act required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008, which reinstated the broad scope of individuals protected under the ADA and Section 504\u00b9. The handbook also outlines the roles and responsibilities of various VA offices and officials in ensuring compliance with Section 504, as well as the procedures for handling complaints, appeals, and enforcement actions related to disability discrimination\u00b9. The handbook is intended to help VA foster optimal organizational environments to protect the rights of beneficiaries, with disabilities, of VA programs or activities\u00b9.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTING SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1134&FType=2.\r\n(2) Department of Veterans Affairs VA DIRECTIVE 6500 February 24, 2021 VA .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1254&FType=2.\r\n(3) Blind Justice-VA Vet Center Update - Auditors United. https://auditorsunited.org/a/2023/03/25/blind-justice-va-vet-center-update/.\r\n(4) Department of Veterans Affairs VA HANDBOOK 6500 February 24, 2021 RISK .... https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=1255&FType=2.\u201d\r\n\r\n8. \u201ccould it be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a hypothetical question that may depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. However, based on the web search results I found, it could be argued that an employee of a federal agency deliberately misconstruing or skewing program and activity information amounts to discrimination if it results in denying or limiting the access, benefits, or opportunities of qualified individuals with disabilities to any program or activity operated by the federal agency. According to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2074, which prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity operated by recipients of federal funds or conducted by a federal agency, discrimination may include:\r\n\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Denying a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services;\r\n- Affording a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, or services that is not equal to that afforded others;\r\n- Providing a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;\r\n- Providing different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;\r\n- Otherwise limiting a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefits, or services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if an employee of a federal agency intentionally provides false or misleading information about a program or activity that affects the rights, privileges, advantages, or opportunities of individuals with disabilities, it could be considered a form of discrimination under Section 504. However, this would have to be proven by evidence and may be subject to legal defenses and exceptions.\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/10/2023\r\n(1) HHS Issues New Proposed Rule to Strengthen Prohibitions Against .... https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/09/07/hhs-issues-new-proposed-rule-to-strengthen-prohibitions-against-discrimination-on-basis-of-disability-in-health-care-and-human-services-programs.html.\r\n(2) Employment Laws: Disability & Discrimination - U.S. Department of Labor. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/publications/fact-sheets/employment-laws-disability-and-discrimination.\r\n(3) Disability Discrimination: Overview of the Laws - U.S. Department of .... https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/guid/ocr/disabilityoverview.html.\r\n(4) Disability Discrimination - U.S. Department of Education. https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/pro-students/disability-pr.html.\u201d\n",

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework.

Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?\r\n\r\n26.   The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx\r\n\r\n27.   Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.   He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n29.   From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n30.   As I understand it, the VASP is set to be introduced at \u201c\u2026.the beginning of October\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0\r\n\r\n31.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ubxwuoe4rxoc2j80mrfo/Automated-Decision-Support-VBA-Home-Loans.pdf?rlkey=rs0pnc6x8j9lmm194fgiq9ez9&dl=0\r\n\r\n32.   There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct. Executed on September 24, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n/s/Michael Bass Locke\r\n\r\n127 Delvalle St.\r\n\r\n Melbourne Beach, FL 32951\r\n\r\n (321) 506-9557\r\n\r\nMbl22885@msn.com",

You said \u201c\u2026we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely\u2026\u201d and I can only surmise you\u2019re pulling from the m26-3(4.03)(c) as it says \u201cTechnicians should determine if contact with a borrower is required during the AOS process.  If contact information in VALERI is no longer valid or numbers provided are not in service, the loan technician must attempt to locate a working number using an online search engine or other available search options and document the case notes.  If a borrower is in active bankruptcy or was active in bankruptcy during the default, no contact should be initiated with the borrower.  If the borrower initiates contact with VA, the technician should only discuss general information regarding the loan and the VA Home Loan Program and document a summary of the conversation in the case notes.\u201d Given the full context of m26-3(4.03)(c), speaking \u201cvaguely\u201d or \u201cgenerally\u201d only applies when a VA Home Loan technician is conducting an Adequacy of Servicing review.

Your loan is in active bankruptcy with Plant Home Lending and while you are under the protection of the Bankruptcy Courts and engaging with Planet Home Lending through the legal process of Bankruptcy we are unable to interfere with that legal process.  If you have questions regarding your loan while it is in bankruptcy we encourage you to discuss it with your bankruptcy attorney and the judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou did get a Relief of Stay from the courts to discuss loss mitt options, we can only discuss loss mitt options vaguely because your loan is still under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court.  We have tried to discuss loss mitt options with you, by inquiring if your ex-wife would be willing to execute/sign an agreement.

Upon my initial request for a CARES ACT related forbearance, servicer Planet Home Lending attempted to require providing a time range and specific impact of COVID-19 related hardship\r\n\r\n See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n3.       The CARES ACT required servicers of federally backed loans to grant forbearance under the CARES ACT upon a borrower simply attesting to a hardship relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n4.       Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n5.       The VALERI system, which stands for Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Electronic Reporting Interface, is a web-based application that allows VA employees and mortgage servicers to monitor and assist Veterans with VA-guaranteed home loans.\r\n\r\n6.       Per the VALERI records for my loan as of 6/22/2022, Planet Home Lending failed to inform the VA that my continued default was COVID-19 related until 5/10/2022. See https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757\r\n\r\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/#file-1023757]\r\n\r\n7.       The same VALERI records demonstrate that the 5/2020 CARES ACT forbearance was never reported to the VA, despite 38 C.F.R. 36.4317 requiring any forbearance be reported after approval \u201c\u2026by the seventh day of the following month\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n8.       Nearly 2 years after 2 years after the first CARES ACT related forbearance for the home loan, servicer Planet Home Lending eventually adhered to VA Circular 26-20-17 and applied the \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d designation to the home loan. See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mznrglt98owhm4g9uq7gr/phl-first-cares-act-forbearance.pdf?rlkey=9l6fhirvn1imrxzlwulza514m&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys96eAuPQ$>\r\n\r\n9.       This delay complicated communication between myself and the VA considerably, as the VA Loan Guaranty employee tasked with intervening seemed to take the content of the VALERI record as indisputable gospel.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c18bf6632hwxn0dxyjfri/Marcus-Young-Letters.pdf?rlkey=38aukt3tzjraig5hkllxfy4bp&dl=0\r\n\r\n10.   Further, due to the delay designating the home loan as COVID-19 affected, the home loan was apparently never considered for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12.\r\n\r\n11.   In the final VA partial claim payment program rule issued via the Federal Register, the VA specifically identified VA Circular 26-20-12 as the means for which servicer\u2019s were to use to bring a loan current that defaulted prior to Covid-19.  See https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-05-28/pdf/2021-11373.pdf\r\n\r\n12.    On 6/17/2022 VA Loan Guaranty Officer Marcus Young was questioned regarding my lack of consideration for relief under VA Circular 26-20-12, he responded \u201cThe circulars referenced are specific to COVID-19. Your default occurred prior to COVID-19.\u201d See https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npatrygy03jgtpo9t304j/Marcus-Young-No-26-20-12.pdf?rlkey=q1vd2o7cg3ndenuge80ri9i1j&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys-d0gD9U$>\r\n\r\n13.    Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n14.   VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c) states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n15.   Planet Home Lending was seemingly aware of VA Circular 26-20-12(5)(c), and attempted to circumvent as much, as the VALERI records reflect a \u201crepayment plan approved\u201d entered on 8/19/2020 with a start date of 5/1/2020 and an estimated cure date of 11/1/2020.\r\n\r\n16.   Per 38 C.F.R. 36.4301 \u201cA repayment plan is a written executed agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.\u201d\r\n\r\n17.   On 8/20/2020 I received an e-mail from VA Home Loan Technician Louis Krejci that stated in part \u201cThe servicer responded to you and sent you an email with what is required to send to them for a completed package. They will not review your file until a completed package is received. I suggest reviewing their email and submit the requested documents. They own your loan and require a completed package to review.\u201d\r\n\r\n18.   Planet Home Lending utilizes an online \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d for the processing of loss mitigation packages.\r\n\r\n19.   The \u201cLoan Solution Center\u201d includes a \u201cDocument Center\u201d displaying  documents submitted by a borrower and loss mitigation options offered by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n20.   The \u201cDocument Center\u201d for my home loan shows no repayment plan offered or written agreement concerning a repayment plan.\r\n\r\n21.   \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives\r\n\r\n22.     \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\n23.   https://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/\r\n\r\n24.    \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk\r\n\r\n25.   \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n26.

Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/omqhswxuolw7yi8oxmjbl/HPC-email.pdf?rlkey=8oder8r6fysrseveeg9uraj0e&dl=0\r\n\r\n28.   He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n29.   From this point, I proceeded to engage with the  Grassroots and Constituent Affairs Coordinator of the Wounded Warrior Project for more information concerning the VASP program.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h0h82au489z8qonqaedf2/JuanWWPVASP.pdf?rlkey=7tz1198ig8g0wm78e6w1q1taf&dl=0__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYys2Kd6U-g$>\r\n\r\n30.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration introduced their \u201cAutomated Decision Support (ADS)\u201d system in December of 2021, and has since escalated it\u2019s usage to \u201c\u2026enable faster, more accurate, and consistent decisions for Veterans and their beneficiaries\u201d concerning benefits claims.

There\u2019s nothing publicly available stating that the Department of Veterans Affairs Benefits Administration is using their \u201cADS\u201d system in the processing of claims related to VA Home Loans, but it seems likely, or at the least, a reasonable accommodation for the estimated 147,000 presumably disabled veterans with defaulted loans unknowingly awaiting the introduction of the VASP program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the proceeding information I\u2019m asking that the court extend the time allowed for the MMM process until such time as the Department of Veterans Affairs introduces their Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the\r\n\r\nInformation contained within this e-mail  is true and correct.

From what I can tell, the additional commentary period was requested due to MBA/HPC being completely in the dark regarding a \u201cwritten program description, outline or framework\u201d for VASP.  The request for an additional commentary period is interesting considering it could be argued that MBA/HPC have commented on VASP already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing from Brendan Kelleher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, September 6, 2023 1:32 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: RE: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with you on both things; first, mandatory means required, and second, this is a huge deal for the community. However, I don\u2019t believe the link to the \u201cLoss-Mitigation Options for Guaranteed Loans\u201d link is the correct link for the VASP. Mainly because MBA is asking for a period of public comment instead of a reopening of it. Moreover, the link already had the comment period close in January of 2023. Meanwhile, MBA is asking for a public comment period in their July 26 letter. I noticed that you copied Brendan Kelleher; did he respond to your e-mail outside of what you\u2019ve sent me thus far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding your question about the 147,000 default home loans, unfortunately, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d speculate that not very many of them are equipped to handle this given that they\u2019re already in a stressful financial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to say thank you for handing me this puzzle.

It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysq8bMT2w$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysWFVPPRk$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf?__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYyspIx6wwc$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The VA already has a similar option called a \u201crefunding.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Matt Douglas,  Vice President of Mortgage Policy for the Housing Policy Council, has stated that a key difference between the \u201crefund\u201d and the \u201cVASP Program\u201d is that the number of considered loans could go from a couple dozen a year to tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. He also stated that as of 8/26/2023 the VA \u201chave not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to recap, the program was supposed to be implemented on 7/1/2023, but wasn\u2019t. The VA hasn\u2019t shared anything specific with the groups representing mortgage companies. There are potentially as many as 147,000 veteran homeowners at risk of losing their homes and are most likely completely unaware of this new program.  The number of loans/mortgages potentially considered under the program is a number the VA (in my opinion) is not at all equipped to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Juan Valdez <jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org<mailto:jvaldez@woundedwarriorproject.org>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2023 4:22 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com> <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSubject: GCR Referral - VASP Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://app.salesforceiq.com/t.png?c=outlook&t=AFwhZf2HRzOX2wavcs3oNbv6sa5Jyt-GRZO48MjO7-Pj-WPNiS-nRWkHyHdNeOy-N01bNHcnxBPK2JVwqonW3JtFJo-jY4iajTm16ug2RCFrFeMhZwk9C5lTrvCVlz539f2GMQGesXKT]Hi Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you\u2019re having a great week.

Specifically, the portion that states \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  My understanding is that based on the plain writing,  \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The VA employee I\u2019ve engaged with to this point has stated \u201cAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u2018discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When pressed for further clarification on the provided interpretation, the employee declined to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan this office (or someone within the VA with expertise regarding \u201cplain writing\u201d) please provide input on the plain writing meaning of \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 24, 2023 10:45 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>; Krejci, Louis, VBAPHNX <Louis.Krejci@va.gov<mailto:Louis.Krejci@va.gov>>\r\nCc: SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>; VA Hotline <VAHotline@va.gov<mailto:VAHotline@va.gov>>; Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; Jeffrey Badgley <jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jbadgley@badgleylawgroup.com>>; Jon Masters <jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com<mailto:jmasters@badgleylawgroup.com>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Case No. 11190053 Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

You say \u201cVA\u2019s system was unable to reflect all the necessary changes for the COVID pandemic.  Unfortunately, VA had to spend it resources building out the Partial Claim program.  So, while the servicer was updating the VA regarding the forbearances, unfortunately our system is not able to identify if was a CARES Act forbearance or a regular forbearance.  Home Lending reported to VA a special forbearance was added from 8/19/20 \u2013 11/1/20. This doesn\u2019t mean more special forbearances weren\u2019t completed with Planet Home Lending, this is all that was reported to VA during this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Per VA Circular 26-20-17 \u201cTo identify borrowers who have been impacted by COVID-19, VA is replacing the reason for default of \u201cEnergy/Environmental Cost\u201d with \u201cNational Emergency Declaration\u201d in the Electronic Default Notice (EDN) event. When a borrower requests forbearance due to COVID-19, servicers should use the new reason for default when reporting the EDN and then report the Special Forbearance event. Effective June 1, 2020, VALERI will accept the new reason for default prior to the 61st day of delinquency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Further, I know your statement is nonsense (if not an outright lie) based on the VALERI loan information and notes provided pursuant to my 5/17/2022 FOIA request. Said records clearly demonstrate whatever forbearance entered by Planet Home Lending in VALERI was done in accordance with VA Circular 26-20-17. You're free to review those records via the link below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysSLjR8Lw$> [https://web.archive.org/web/20230130153859/https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/valeri-home-loan-information-128369/]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

VA will be unable to assist as this appears to be an action against your servicer and we are unable to participate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. On one hand you say that the VA is unable to discuss loss mitigation options, yet here you attempt to indirectly discuss loss mitigation options by stating and asking \"You had advised 'The Veteran said that even if his loan servicer provided him a package to keep the home his ex-wife would not sign off on that because she wants him to sell the home.'  Is this still the case?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Why does the apparent CARES ACT information in VALERI as provided by Marcus Young not align with the information provided by servicer Planet Home Lending in their CFPB complaint response?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Will the VA please uphold it\u2019s duty to assist and obtain copies of servicer Planet Home Lending\u2019s \u201ccollection records\u201d from 5/01/2020 to 8/16/2022?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Is the VA a servicer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 6. Is the VA a servicer to my home loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Does the \u201cguidance\u201d you provided directly state the VA is prevented from speaking with a veteran borrower with a home under the protection of a bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Are you saying the \u201cguidance\u201d states the only time that the VA can engage with a veteran borrower regarding a home loan subject to the protection of the bankruptcy courts is after that loan terminates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. How is it possible for a loan to terminate that\u2019s subject to the protection of the bankruptcy court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u201cVA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u2026\u201d is a compound-complex sentence that has two independent clauses (VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy and VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim) joined by a coordinating conjunction (however) and one dependent clause (if the borrower reaches out to VA) that modifies the second independent clause. The second independent clause means that VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement if the borrower reaches out to VA. The phrase \u201cshould the loan terminate and VA pays a claim\u201d is a conditional clause that describes a possible scenario that would result in the loss of entitlement for the borrower. It does not imply that VA will only discuss options and entitlements in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. \u201cThe VA will introduce a new Servicing Purchase Program in July. It's a new way of making a \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019 in the waterfall to keep veterans in homes, said John Bell III, executive director of the agency. Through the initiative, the VA will take a loan back, pay and make the servicer whole, and put the borrower on an interest rate that\u2019s not available in the marketplace.\u201d https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/usda-va-tease-loss-mit-tribal-land-initiatives__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysq8bMT2w$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. \u201cMBA Submits Recommendations on the VA Servicing Purchase Program on Monday, MBA and the Housing Policy Council submitted recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding its new Servicing Purchase Program (VASP). VASP is expected to be introduced as VA\u2019s new loss mitigation program for distressed veteran borrowers for high-interest rate environments. MBA\u2019s recommendations follow several conversations with the VA throughout the development of VASP.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/may/mba-newslink-wednesday-may-31-2023/mba-advocacy-update-may-30-2023/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysBYSMot0$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. \u201cDespite the VA\u2019s engagement with industry in recent months, VA has not provided any written program description, outline or framework. MBA and HPC believe stakeholders should have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program\u2019s design and implementation. Specific issues that require greater transparency include the maximum number of borrowers served, the ability to provide relief promptly, VASP\u2019s compliance with Regulation X (RESPA), and the ability to facilitate successful servicing transfers.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/newslink.mba.org/mba-newslinks/2023/august/mba-newslink-monday-aug-7-2023/mba-advocacy-update-aug-7-tk/__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysnT2_ixo$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. \u201cA solution like this is needed because approximately 147,000 veteran borrowers are estimated to be behind on their mortgage payments and those with note rates below the current market rate will not be able to achieve an affordable payment with a traditional loan modification.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.mba.org/docs/default-source/advertising/vasp-review-process-request_mba.hpc_july-2023.pdf__;!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysC7e0pl8$>?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiduciary relationships may be implied in law and such relationships are premised upon the specific factual situation surrounding the transaction, as well as the relationship of the parties.

Of course, you may disregard this request but moving forward we will only be responding to this communication chain.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the 46 items that you have identified below, and we determined responded to them previously in prior responses (which we can provide again) or there is no action for us to respond.  If there are ones that are new that we have not responded to feel free to let us know the specific ones and we will review and respond.\r\n\r\nAs for the inquiry in the Bankruptcy guidance, you have failed to provide the full guidance.  Please review the full guidance below and understand that we must comply with the full guidance.\r\n\r\nWhen a borrower files for bankruptcy protection, servicers are typically prevented from making contact.  Servicers must report the bankruptcy events in VALERI to include the type of bankruptcy (Chapter 7, 11 or 13 filing) and provide updates such as relief filed, relief granted, dismissed, or discharged.  VA will not attempt contact with Veterans who have filed bankruptcy; however, if the borrower reaches out to VA, VA will discuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\r\n\r\nAt this this time, your loan has not terminated and therefore we cannot \u201cdiscuss the Veteran\u2019s options and the loss of entitlement should the loan terminate and VA pays a claim.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs for your request to engage with our attorneys, they do not engage directly with Veterans but through us.  If you have a specific question, we can reach out to them and request them provide us guidance.\r\n\r\nWe are also in receipt of your inquiry into the VASP program.  VA has not publicly announced this program and does have not a confirmed date for which a new program will be announced.  Implementation of new programs may take many months as the mortgage industry has to adapt policies and technology to any changes made to the VA Home Loan program.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we have advised you before you can either continue to argue our policies with us or you can begin to work with us and try to resolve your home loan delinquency once the debt is out of the protection of the Bankruptcy courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 8:58 PM\r\nTo: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSubject: Re: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe servicer or the VA-assigned technician may initiate the refund consideration process at any time during the life of the loan.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4%20Chapter%209%20Refunds%20-%205-2017.docx<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/m26_04/M26-4*20Chapter*209*20Refunds*20-*205-2017.docx__;JSUlJSU!!Iwwt!QizZlr6Dw12F82JMBgRqKcHSvN6MH9aBdYTcaG64DXk28A9fQbMoyNH-Jbu95WLVhYysH4oxF-o$>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDefinitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce all required documentation is received from the servicer and borrower, and the VA appraisal has been completed, VA will conduct an analysis and complete a refund decision process.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the previous link. Granted, federal courts have found federal agency manuals have no \u201clegal force\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVA circular 26-20-12 was rescinded on 7/1/2021, so it's not in effect anymore. For the time that it was, technically the VA Disaster Loan Modification and VA Streamline Modification would be an issue based on the wording that servicers were to \u201c\u2026ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.\u201d They both use a trial payment plan in the place of a traditional loan modification packet.The streamline \u201cModification must realize at least a 10% reduction in principal and interest portion of the payment,\u201d so it\u2019s a little more strenuous than the disaster. I think part of the difference between the refund and VASP is servicers being \u201cmade whole,\u201d but it seems like the VA would have a good argument against making a servicer whole if a servicer failed to follow VA Circular 26-20-12. Granted, based on my experience, the VA seems deferential to what \u201cyou guys\u201d want, but it\u2019s still the federal government and I imagine they don\u2019t want to pay out money if they don\u2019t have to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you say \u201cmandatory,\u201d do you mean that the VA will require servicers to refer defaulted home loans where no other loss mitigation options are possible to the VA for VASP consideration? I know the VA started using \u201cAI\u201d to process disability benefit claims about a year before chatgpt was introduced, had considerable success, and expanded the \u201cpilot program.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019d be that hard to extend that to processing VASP consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nd From: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\n\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 7:48 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow in red are my best answers to your questions.

Your July 26, 2023 joint letter states in part \u201c\u2018As we understand VASP, the decision to modify a borrower's loan rests with the VA,\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Yet, servicers continue to evaluate their borrowers for all available options. In other words, servicers continue to communicate and engage with their delinquent borrowers until the VA approves the purchase of the loan and accepts transfer of the loan from the servicer.\u2019 This dynamic \u2018dislocates the traditional regulatory relationship between the servicer and the borrower.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan\u2019t the current VA refund process be initiated by the VA without the consent of the servicer? That is a technical legal question that I don\u2019t know the answer to, but since it requires a servicing transfer (which is a highly technical process that requires cooperation), and the purchase of the loan from the servicer, the servicer would almost certainly need to consent to it.\r\n\r\n Ultimately, isn\u2019t it solely the decision of the VA as to whether or not a loan will be refunded? Definitely not my understanding as the program currently works.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s different between the old refund and VASP? The new program would be mandatory, and instead of a couple dozen of loans a year, it could be tens of thousands. There are a whole lot of other changes, but those are two big ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d That\u2019s right, but my understanding is that there are currently no loss mitigation options that a servicer must offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on # 2 and 3, do you guys have any information detailing compliance with VA Circular 26-20-12? Nope-no information on this.\r\n\r\nVA Circular 26-20-12 was in place from 4/9/2020 until 7/1/2021. In that time, what number of defaulted VA home loans were referred to the VA for possible refunding pursuant to 26-20-12? Haven\u2019t seen a number on this, but based on verbal information from the VA I would guess less than 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, do you guys represent Planet Home Lending? The Housing Policy Council does not represent Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Matt Douglas <matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org<mailto:matt.douglas@housingpolicycouncil.org>>\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2023 1:49 PM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nCc: Kelleher, Brendan <bkelleher@mba.org<mailto:bkelleher@mba.org>>\r\nSubject: RE: Veterans Assistance Servicing Purchase (VASP) program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Michael,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they have not shared a detailed/comprehensive process with us.

The VA has a disaster loan mitigation option that could have been applied, but Planet Home Lending did not offer it. The CARES Act was signed in March 2020 and offered protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states that mortgage assistance must be provided regardless of delinquency status. The VA then issued a circular on April 8, 2020 that stated servicers have to give borrowers the opportunity to pursue all loss mitigation options to bring their loan current. The VA also issued a circular in July 2021 that introduced the COVID- 19 Refund Modification which allows for significant payment reductions and does not require a financial evaluation. Despite this, Planet Home Lending began court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure, and only offered a loan modification with a trial payment period in December 2021, which could have been done at any point during the default period. I rejected the modification offer due to the applicable laws and regulations that favor the veteran, such as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A and Brown v. Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I currently have a VA home loan through Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n2. In September of 2019 the area the property is located was under a mandatory evacuation due to Hurricane Dorian. The area was declared a federal disaster area in December of 2019.\r\n\r\n3. In 10/1/2019 I missed the first home loan payment.\r\n\r\n4. In December of 2019 I submitted an incomplete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n5. On 1/3/2020 I was denied consideration for any loss mitigation options by Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n6. The VA has a disaster loss mitigation option that allows for a loan modification absent a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n7. The VA disaster loan modification specifies a trial payment plan is used to verify income in lieu of a complete loss mitigation package.\r\n\r\n8. Planet Home Lending had the ability to offer a VA Disaster Loan Modification and/or a special forbearance at this point, but does not.\r\n\r\n9. In early 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic begins.\r\n\r\n10. On 3/27/2020, THE CARES ACT is signed into law.\r\n\r\n11. The CARES Act offers protection to homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government who are facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and explicitly states in section 4022(b)(1) that mortgage assistance provided pursuant to the CARES ACT was to be provided \"...regardless of delinquency status.\"\r\n\r\n12. The Department of Veterans Affairs makes use of circulars issued via the official VA website to provide current policies and procedures to VA-approved lenders and servicers.\r\n\r\n13. The VA explicitly states via their official website that circulars are supplemental to VA home loan regulations.\r\n\r\n14. On 4/8/2020, the VA issues \u201cCircular 26-20-12\u201d via the official VA website in response to the CARES ACT.\r\n\r\n15. Section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12 explicitly states \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer.\u201d\r\n\r\n16. I was eligible for a disaster loan modification for the entirety of my default period, but at no point was I offered a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n17. As a result of section 1 of VA Circular 26-20-12, Planet Home Lending was required to offer a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Planet Home Lending continues to maintain that I was ineligible for any loss mitigation options, then the following applies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Section 3 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cThe borrower, not the servicer, is entitled to determine the period of the forbearance...\u201d\r\n\r\n19. Planet Home Lending stated the following regarding forbearance applied to my home loan:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n20. Subsection c of section 5 of VA Circular 26-20-12 states \u201cServicers should review loan files for all possible loss mitigation options no later than 30 days before the forbearance period is scheduled to end. Servicers should document such reviews in their loan servicing systems. If no loss mitigation options are possible, in cases where the home has equity, servicers must refer the file to the relevant Regional Loan Center for VA\u2019s consideration of a loan refunding.\u201d\r\n\r\n21. No such review was conducted or documented within the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface (VALERI).\r\n\r\n22. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201chome equity\u201d as \u201c...the difference between the home's reasonable value and the outstanding balance of all liens on the property.\u201d\r\n\r\n23. The VA via 38 CFR \u00a7 36.4301 defines \u201creasonable value\u201d as \u201c...that figure which represents the amount a reputable and qualified appraiser, unaffected by personal interest, bias, or prejudice, would recommend to a prospective purchaser as a proper price or cost in the light of prevailing conditions.\u201d\r\n\r\n24. Per the applicable appraisal on file with the VA and Planet Home Lending, the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the home was/is $292,000.\r\n\r\n25. At the time of default, the principal balance of the home was $263,329.99.\r\n\r\n26. If the first forbearance period expired in August of 2020 and no loss mitigation options were possible, in July of 2020 Planet Home Lending was required to refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding, as there was no way the outstanding balance of the home exceeded the \u201creasonable value\u201d of $292,000.\r\n\r\n27. At no time did Planet Home lending refer the home loan to the applicable VA Regional Loan Center for possible refunding.\r\n\r\n28. On 7/1/2021, VA Circular 26-20-12 is rescinded.\r\n\r\n29. On 7/23/2021 the VA issues Circular 26-21-13.\r\n\r\n30. The purpose of VA Circular 26-21-13 is to provide \u201c...VA\u2019s waterfall of home retention options for helping borrowers affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\r\n\r\n31. VA Circular 26-21-13 also \u201c...announces the COVID-19 Refund Modification, a type of loan modification specific to those borrowers needing payment reductions when exiting COVID-19 forbearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n32. While section 5 of VA Circular 26-21-13 identifies eligibility criteria for borrowers to whom the home retention waterfall will apply, no such eligibility criteria is provided for the COVID-19 Refund Modification. It should be noted that Planet Home Lending presently reflects the last payment received on the loan as 1/1/2020.\r\n\r\n33. The COVID-19 Refund Modification is a type of loan modification that allows for significant reductions in a borrower's monthly payments. The indebtedness is secured as a junior lien in favor of VA that does not accrue interest or require monthly payments, and only becomes due when the property is sold, the loan is paid off, or the loan is refinanced. VA can purchase indebtedness up to 30 percent of a borrower's unpaid principal balance, and does not require a financial evaluation for every case.\r\n\r\n34. On 9/30/21 Planet Home Lending begins court proceedings to obtain a foreclosure.\r\n\r\n 35. On 11/4/2021 Isubmits a complete loss mitigation package to Planet Home Lending.\r\n\r\n36. On 12/27/2021 Planet Home Lending puts forth an offer for \u201cStandard Modification\u201d (ie Traditional Loan modification) with a trial payment period.\r\n\r\n37. Besides in name, the offer is a disaster loan modification.\r\n\r\n38. Due to the proceeding facts, I rejected the loan modification as it could have been offered at any time within the default period.\r\n\r\n39. The U.S. Congress has put in place a number of laws and practices to favor veterans as it relates to receiving benefits from the VA. This includes 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which requires the VA to help the claimant develop their claim for benefits. Furthermore, under Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 115 S. Ct. 552, 130 L. Ed.2d 462, any interpretive doubt is to be resolved in favor of the veteran, as seen in the case of Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\r\n\r\n40. Per 38 USC \u00a7 5103A, the VA \u201c...shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant\u2019s claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary.\u201d\r\n\r\n41. The VA home loan benefit is authorized by Title 38, Chapter 37 of the United States Code.\r\n\r\n42. The VA has a duty to assist my claims for benefits related to my home loan.\r\n\r\n43. The VA was and is aware of the issues described herein.\r\n\r\n44. The VA failed and refused to act concerning those issues.\r\n\r\n45. I was forced to declare bankruptcy due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n46. The home is in delinquency due to the VA\u2019s failure and refusal to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Friday, July 8, 2022 9:35 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will follow up with the Phoenix Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Thursday, July 7, 2022 11:06 PM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the following hasn\u2019t been explained by the VA:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom: Michael Locke\r\n\r\nSent: Thursday, June 23, 2022 3:04 PM\r\nTo: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@VA.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@VA.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov> <marcus.young@va.gov<mailto:marcus.young@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain the discrepancies between what VA Phoenix Regional Loan Center Loan Administration Officer Marcus Young is saying and what my servicer is saying? I will most likely have further questions based on the answers I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour loan was reported in default to the VA and due for the 10/1/19 installment. The reason for default was martial difficulties. When we talked to you on August 14, 2020, you confirmed that the reason for default was martial difficulties. According to our notes, you submitted a loss mitigation assistance application in 2019, however the servicer deemed the application incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanet\u2019s investigation revealed that you initially submitted an online portal inquiry on December 3, 2019. The submission was partially completed, however, did not indicate whether the disaster hardship was resolved or ongoing. Planet issued both acknowledgement and missing items letters (enclosed) on that same date. To proceed with a Disaster Modification, Planet must verify that the hardship was resolved, the borrower returned to work and with no negative long-term change in the household income occurring. Despite numerous attempts, we did not receive the required information. Therefore, on January 3, 2020, a loss mitigation denial letter (enclosed) was issued.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Letter from Marcus Young dated 5/20/2022:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Locke ever under the CARES FB?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mr. Locke was approved for a Special Forbearance on August 19, 2020. The Special Forbearance was extended on December 10, 2020, and again on April 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I responded to the proceeding as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the above what is reflected in VALERI? If so, does this mean I have CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance eligibility remaining? If so, why didn\u2019t the VA intervene at the time Planet Home Lending filed for foreclosure and say I had eligibility remaining? Planet Home Lending has provided conflicting information regarding the forbearance dates. Will the VA please clarify with Planet Home Lending the dates where CARES ACT COVID-19 forbearance was applied to the property, as well as request and provide all documentation substantiating as much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Mr Young responded to the proceeding with the following:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2022 Repayment Plan: Approved: 8/19/20, start date: 5/1/20 estimated cure date: 10/1/20\r\n\r\n\u2022 Special Forbearance Plan: Approved: 8/19/20 estimated cure date: 11/1/20.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planet Home Lending response on 6/22/2022  to CFPB Complaint:\r\n\r\n\u2018In May 2020, the Loan was flagged as COVID-19 impacted and upon request, was approved for a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The forbearance plan was extended multiple times August 2020 through August 31, 2021. Planet sent the enclosed correspondence to determine if you were still in need of a forbearance and did not receive a response. Therefore, the forbearance expired on August 31, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 2021, upon receipt of an online request from you, you were approved for an extension of the COVID-19 forbearance plan, which was good through November 1, 2021. As an additional courtesy, Planet backdated the forbearance plan to September 1, 2021, waived your late fees and ensured no negative credit reporting was furnished to the three major agencies pursuant to the CARES Act while you were on a forbearance. Therefore, you were provided with a COVID-19 forbearance plan for a total of 18 months, which is the maximum number permitted by the VA for loans with a COVID-19 hardship on or prior to June 1, 2020.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 11:26 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll loss mitigation package documents were submitted to Planet Home Lending as of 6/26/2022.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>\r\nSent: Tuesday, July 5, 2022 10:22 AM\r\nTo: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: RE: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning Mr. Locke,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have responded to this inquiry previously in the official correspondence that has been sent to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Locke you have two options, 1) you can start working with VA and your servicer to resolve your delinquency or discuss an alternative to foreclosure, or 2) you can continue to argue with VA about policies and regulations at which we will not be responding because we have already provided you our response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Michael Locke <mbl22885@msn.com<mailto:mbl22885@msn.com>>\r\nSent: Saturday, July 2, 2022 10:05 AM\r\nTo: Post, Andrew, VBADENV <andrew.post@va.gov<mailto:andrew.post@va.gov>>; Toth, Jennifer, VBACLEV <Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Toth1@va.gov>>; Young, Marcus, VBAPHNX <Marcus.Young@va.gov<mailto:Marcus.Young@va.gov>>\r\nCc: Veterans Experience Office <Vets-Experience@va.gov<mailto:Vets-Experience@va.gov>>; SECVARequest <SECVARequest@va.gov<mailto:SECVARequest@va.gov>>\r\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Request for Discrepancy Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer Marcus Young \u201cUnderstand at this point they have allowed for the authorized amount of time under the COVID FB requirement, they can consider extending forbearance if you qualify for an extended FB.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Planet Home Lending version of events is accepted, Planet Home Lending was required and failed to refer the loan to the VA for refunding in July of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \u201cThe servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current.

During the COVID-19 national emergency the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through its home loan program, continues to work toward keeping Veterans and stakeholders safe. On March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), Public Law 116-136. The CARES Act protects borrowers with Federally backed mortgage loans who are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 national emergency. These protections are outlined below. The servicer must ensure the borrower has been given every opportunity to pursue all possible loss mitigation options in order to bring their loan current. Failure to do so could impact a future claim payment and could lead to other legal or administrative action(s) against the servicer. The Cares Act preempts section 3 of Circular 26-20-7, 'Special Relief for those Potentially Impacted by COVID-19.'\" See VA Circular 26-20-12(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

So what gives?\r\n[image/jpeg]\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would logically follow if these questions had been answered previously, you would have simply said as much, like you did with the first question asked on 11/16/2023.\r\n\r\nI take your non-response concerning the duty to assist request to mean VBA Loan Guaranty is refusing the request.\r\n\r\nBecause they didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to figure out.\r\n\r\nI was married to a former DCF/CPS investigator/supervisor. You read that and you think whatever,  but what I mean is that child abused investigators for the state have no legal authority and generally have to BS to close out cases. When a report comes in and they go out to investigate, they generally don\u2019t have a warrant or enough to get a warrant, but they still have to close out their cases. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is or what their socioeconomic status is, no one is initially cooperative when a child abuse investigator shows up at their doorstep. So truth be told, they have to be pretty good at BSing. From what I experienced and what the spouses of other child abuse investigators substantiated, it\u2019s hard to turn off the exploitative BS when you come home. They have to do it so much, it becomes second nature. Most child abuse investigators burnout within a year. My ex did it for 9. Beyond that, she\u2019s 99.99th percentile IQ. Way smarter than me, and I imagine you as well. All of this is to say, I\u2019ve been well trained to deal with this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASP is still going to be a thing, correct? Even so, I\u2019m not counting on that. I\u2019m counting on the circumstances that spurred the NPR investigation aren\u2019t going to change. \u201cA tiger can\u2019t change its stripes,\u201d as the saying goes.\r\n\r\nBecause my servicer didn\u2019t follow VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe my servicer anything, and because you guys didn\u2019t ensure my servicer followed VA Circular 26-20-12, I don\u2019t owe the VA anything either.\r\n\nMichael Locke",

According to a study by Casetext and Stanford CodeX, GPT-4 scored approximately 297 points on the UBE, which is higher than the passing threshold for all UBE jurisdictions. This score places GPT-4 in the 90th percentile of test-takers.\r\n\r\nI am a pro se litigant who is interested in using Casetext's CoCounsel to prepare and file legal documents for my case. I understand that Casetext's CoCounsel does not provide legal advice or representation, and that I am solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of my documents.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned that using Casetext's CoCounsel may be considered the unlicensed practice of law under Rule 10-2.1 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, which defines the practice of law as \"the giving of legal advice or legal assistance to another person\". I am also aware that Rule 10-9.1 allows the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law to issue proposed formal advisory opinions concerning activities which may constitute the unlicensed practice of law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law issue a formal advisory opinion on whether pro se use of Casetext's CoCounsel would constitute the unlicensed practice of law in Florida.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke\r\n127 Delvalle St.\r\nMelbourne Beach, FL 32951\r\nMbl22885@msn.com<mailto:Mbl22885@msn.com>\r\n(321)506-9557<tel:(321)506-9557>\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm reaching out to propose an enhancement to the legal support services offered to our veterans through VA hospital legal clinics. Since 2019, Thomson Reuters has provided their legal research products to the Federal Judiciary. Recently, on January 3, 2024, their contract was updated to incorporate Westlaw Precision, a tool enriched by AI capabilities, suggesting that its innovative AI-assisted features were a significant factor in the contract's renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integration of Westlaw Precision has revolutionized legal research by enabling professionals to conduct searches using conversational language and receive comprehensive, AI-generated responses. This has greatly improved the efficiency of legal research, drawing from a robust collection of legal documents for accurate, authoritative results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the apparent reliability of Precision due to its use by the federal courts, I believe our veterans would greatly benefit from similar access through the VA's legal clinics. This would provide them with unparalleled support in navigating their legal challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how we could extend this advanced legal research capability to our veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "One could argue that the VA's sole source contract with Westlaw for online legal research services indirectly supports the VA's duty to assist veterans in their benefits claims. Given that the VA recognizes the necessity of such a comprehensive legal research tool for its own use in adjudicating claims and legal analysis, it could be argued that veterans should also have access to similar resources to adequately prepare and support their claims. This access could be seen as part of the VA's obligation to provide all necessary assistance to veterans in substantiating their claims, ensuring they have a fair opportunity to present their cases with the best available legal precedents and interpretations.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.highergov.com/contract-opportunity/da10-vba-westlaw-online-subscription-36c10d22q0005-p-f1709/\n",

        "communication": "The argument that the VA's use of specialized legal research tools like those provided by West Publishing Corporation is essential for resolving benefits issues and that similar resources should be made available to veterans to ensure equity and informed decision-making is compelling. This approach aligns with the VA's duty to assist veterans in preparing and substantiating their claims, as outlined in 38 USC \u00a7 5103A. Here are excerpts from relevant case law that support various aspects of this argument:\r\n\r\n  1.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA): The VCAA, codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, mandates the VA to assist veterans in developing their claims for benefits. This assistance includes obtaining records relevant to the claim and providing medical examinations when necessary for decision-making on the claim. The case of David R. Gagne v. Robert A. McDonald illustrates the VA's obligation under the VCAA to make reasonable efforts to assist claimants, highlighting the importance of access to comprehensive resources for claim development??.\r\n\r\n  2.  Duty to Assist in Obtaining Evidence: The VA's duty to assist includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records that can help substantiate a veteran's claim. This principle is further elaborated in Golz v. Shinseki, where the court affirmed the VA's duty to assist as found in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, emphasizing the pro-claimant system and the requirement to develop the veteran's claim fully and sympathetically??.\r\n\r\n  3.  Relevance and Reasonable Efforts: The case of Sullivan v. McDonald discusses the VA's duty to assist in obtaining records, noting that this duty extends only to potentially relevant records. This underscores the necessity for access to tools that can help identify and analyze relevant legal and factual information to support claims??.\r\n\r\n  4.  Empowering Veterans with Information: The argument for providing veterans with access to legal research tools mirrors the VA's duty to assist, as it equips veterans with the necessary information to actively participate in the adjudication of their claims. Cases like Charles v. Principi highlight the VCAA's impact in eliminating the well-grounded-claim requirement and expanding the VA's duty to assist, which can be seen as supporting the broader principle of empowering claimants with information and resources??.\r\n\r\nThese cases illustrate the legal framework underpinning the VA's duty to assist veterans in preparing and substantiating their claims and highlight the importance of access to comprehensive information and resources, both for the VA and veterans. Extending access to specialized legal research tools to veterans can be seen as a natural extension of the VA's duty to assist, promoting equity and informed participation in the claims process.\n",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Part three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. The requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request.\u00a0 Additionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 38873, issued June 30, 2016, at 4-5 and Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev. Ltr. 56488). Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, records have been redacted in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA to remove information constituting privileged attorney-client work product. Section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nAny foreign policy guidance issued by the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control regarding applications to work with Syrian oil filed between October 2017 and December 2020.\r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) seized control of Al-Omar in Deir al-Zour province, home to the largest oil field in Syria. (https://www.dw.com/en/us-backed-sdf-captures-syrias-largest-oil-field-from-islamic-state/a-41066879)\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2020, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Levant Affairs and Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn confirmed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that a company called Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been a given a license from the Office of Foreign Asset Control to work with oil fields under SDF control. Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn stated that the State Department had issued \"foreign policy guidance\" in support of Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's application, stating that U.S. officials \"support trying to get the economy of northeast Syria up and running to the extent it can under the present conditions of war.\" (https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/12/09/trump-administration-helped-gop-donors-get-syria-oil-deal/)\r\n\r\nDelta Crescent Energy, LLC was granted a license in April 2020, per documents released by the Office of Foreign Asset Control to investigative journalist Zack Kopplin on December 9. Three other companies had applied for a license from the Office and were rejected, according to an earlier report by Kopplin. (https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq)\r\n\r\nI am seeking expedited processing of my request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity in a matter of current exigency to the American public..\r\n\r\nIn response to Rayburn's remarks during the December 9 hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn admitted that the State Department had not discussed an oil for any other company. Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas noted in response that Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been co-founded by a prominent donor to Republican Party causes. \"We are just leaving what has been a dark period of corruption and graft, sometimes fraud, that has been looked the other way, sometimes, I would argue, encouraged by the Trump administration,\" Castro said.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the public has an urgent need to know as much as possible about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's relationship with the U.S. Government and with U.S. Government activities in Syria, especially as U.S. troops are risking life and limb to safeguard Syrian oil fields.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump had stated in October and November 2019 that U.S. military forces are remain in Syria \"only for the oil\" and that they \"may have to fight for the oil.\" At least two U.S. service members have died in Syria since he made these statements, and at least four were injured in an August 2020 skirmish with Russian forces (https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/us-troops-injured-russian-forces-syria-402347).\r\n\r\nForeign countries have condemned the U.S. presence on Syrian oil fields, increasing the risk to Americans stationed there. The Turkish foreign ministry called any U.S. move to extract Syrian oil \"utterly unacceptable\" (https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-slams-us-over-oil-deal-with-ypg-in-syria-157090), while the Syrian government denounced the rumored deal as \"an assault against Syria\u2019s sovereignty\" and \"a continuation of the U.S. hostile approach towards Syria\" (http://www.sana.sy/en/?p=198923).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, federal courts have recognized the public's interest in breaking news, which \"conveys information the public wants quickly,\u201d \u201cwould lose value if it were delayed\" (Am. Civil Liberties Union of N. Cal., 2006 WL 1469418 at *6.), and may have an \"impact\" on the public's political decision-making (Id. at *7).\r\n\r\nSyria policy certainly could impact the public's political decision-making process. The Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria in October 2019 caused several congressional hearings and an high volume of news coverage. The public would undoubtedly have an interest in understanding further developments in U.S. policy in the same region of Syria, especially as the transition to a new presidential administration approaches in January 2021.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay up to $100 in fees, but I also believe that I qualify for a fee waiver as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has been published in the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Petti\n\n",

Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn stated that the State Department had issued \"foreign policy guidance\" in support of Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's application, stating that U.S. officials \"support trying to get the economy of northeast Syria up and running to the extent it can under the present conditions of war.\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2020/12/09/trump-administration-helped-gop-donors-get-syria-oil-deal/)\r\n\r\nDelta Crescent Energy, LLC was granted a license in April 2020, per documents released by the Office of Foreign Asset Control to investigative journalist Zack Kopplin on December 9. Three other companies had applied for a license from the Office and were rejected, according to an earlier report by Kopplin. (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq)\r\n\r\nI am seeking expedited processing of my request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity in a matter of current exigency to the American public..\r\n\r\nIn response to Rayburn's remarks during the December 9 hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary Rayburn admitted that the State Department had not discussed an oil for any other company. Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas noted in response that Delta Crescent Energy, LLC had been co-founded by a prominent donor to Republican Party causes. \"We are just leaving what has been a dark period of corruption and graft, sometimes fraud, that has been looked the other way, sometimes, I would argue, encouraged by the Trump administration,\" Castro said.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the public has an urgent need to know as much as possible about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC's relationship with the U.S. Government and with U.S. Government activities in Syria, especially as U.S. troops are risking life and limb to safeguard Syrian oil fields.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump had stated in October and November 2019 that U.S. military forces are remain in Syria \"only for the oil\" and that they \"may have to fight for the oil.\" At least two U.S. service members have died in Syria since he made these statements, and at least four were injured in an August 2020 skirmish with Russian forces (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/us-troops-injured-russian-forces-syria-402347\r\n\r\nForeign countries have condemned the U.S. presence on Syrian oil fields, increasing the risk to Americans stationed there. The Turkish foreign ministry called any U.S. move to extract Syrian oil \"utterly unacceptable\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-slams-us-over-oil-deal-with-ypg-in-syria-157090), while the Syrian government denounced the rumored deal as \"an assault against Syria\u2019s sovereignty\" and \"a continuation of the U.S. hostile approach towards Syria\" (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=http://www.sana.sy/en/?p=198923).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, federal courts have recognized the public's interest in breaking news, which \"conveys information the public wants quickly,\u201d \u201cwould lose value if it were delayed\" (Am. Civil Liberties Union of N. Cal., 2006 WL 1469418 at *6.), and may have an \"impact\" on the public's political decision-making (Id. at *7).\r\n\r\nSyria policy certainly could impact the public's political decision-making process. The Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria in October 2019 caused several congressional hearings and an high volume of news coverage. The public would undoubtedly have an interest in understanding further developments in U.S. policy in the same region of Syria, especially as the transition to a new presidential administration approaches in January 2021.\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay up to $100 in fees, but I also believe that I qualify for a fee waiver as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has been published in the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Foffice-of-foreign-asset-control-498%252Fpolicy-guidance-for-syrian-oil-department-of-treasury-office-of-foreign-asset-control-105775%252F%253Femail%253DOFACFOIAOffice%252540treasury.gov&url_auth_token=AAATLlkv-iW10ZFS2WiLMQlOnAU%3A1mi8Nx%3ApQJavmtf5yq_PcZdaNZ_AqSibZ0\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 105775-72469533@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 105775\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

For similar responsive records on Use of Force data from January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021, please visit request number #21-9649.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per your communication on February 13, 2022, below is our previous communication from February 1, 2022:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use of force (UOF) data dating from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. This data should include the case number, incident date, incident time, suspect injured indicator, suspect injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), suspect age, suspect gender, suspect ethnicity, suspect weapon type, incident area occurred, whether the officer was injured, force type, and most importantly, badge number associated with the officers involved.\r\n\r\n2. All police shifts for each employee (identified by badge number) from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. This should include the time of start and end for each shift, the date of the shift, and the corresponding badge number of the employee.\r\n\r\n3. Employee demographics for all employees employed from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. All badge numbers linked to the corresponding race, gender, and age if available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #1 of your request, the records you are seeking have been previously provided in another request (see:\u00a0https://lacity.nextrequest.com/requests/21-9649) for Use of Force data for time period January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the following fields are what has been provided: incident date, incident time, area occurred, case number, suspect ethnicity, suspect age, suspect gender, suspect injuries force related (yes or no), suspect injury type description, suspect weapon type description, employee ethnicity, employee injuries force related (yes or no), employee injury description, incident area occurred, employee unit description, force type description, and finding type.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department did not provide Officer badge numbers as they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sections 6254(c) and (k) of the Act. Section 6254(c) exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0Section 6254(k), exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Penal Code.\u00a0Penal Code Section 832.7 states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code.\u00a0[See Penal Code Sections 832.5 and 832.7 and Evidence Code Sections 1043 and 1045]. California case law holds that Evidence Code Section 1043\u00a0et seq.\u00a0is the exclusive means to obtain peace officer personnel records, and as such, they are exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Act.\u00a0[See\u00a0City of Hemet v. Superior Court\u00a0(1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th\u00a01411].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, for the sake of transparency the employee\u2019s ethnicity and unit description have been provided.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to Use of Force data for the time period of October 28, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and #3 of your request, please be advised that, pursuant to California Government Code Section 6253(c), we are still searching for, collecting, and/or reviewing the requested records. Should any records be located we will require time to review the requested records for confidential portions that are exempt from disclosure under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255. We will provide you with a response upon completion of our review. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #2 of your request, please note that in order for the Department to provide the requested data, the Department would have to take affirmative steps to locate all potentially responsive documents, related to sworn personnel, and then manually review and extract the specific information that is being sought. Due to the amount of time it would take to do so and based on the same need to retain confidentiality of certain information, the request is unduly burdensome as interpreted by the courts under the \"public interest\" provision of Government Code Section 6255 of the California Public Records Act. Similarly, the Department asserts the exemption due to our belief that disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public. Therefore, we are denying this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMeghan Leong",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago. Needham was investigated for promoting allegations of the United States' use of biological weapons during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at off-site locations such as the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
