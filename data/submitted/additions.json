The maintenance requirements for these different types of uses vary, so it\u2019s crucial to know which one you\u2019re applying for and how to keep up with the right maintenance:\r\n\r\nStandard Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA approves applications for a standard airworthiness certificate if your registered aircraft complies with one of the following aircraft categories: normal, commuter, utility, transport or acrobatic. You must also maintain a condition that\u2019s safe for operation, as well as conduct preventative maintenance \u2014 any modifications you make to your aircraft must meet the requirements of 14 CFR Parts 21, 43 and 91.\r\n\r\nSpecial Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA issues special airworthiness certificates for primary, restricted, multiple, limited, experimental, provisional and special flight aircraft. To qualify for this certificate, your aircraft must meet several standards detailed in 14 CFR Part 21, 45, 48, 91 and 375, as well as policies that specify additional aircraft maintenance requirements.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
