Silk Road allowed users to buy and sell illegal drugs, counterfeit goods, and other illegal items anonymously using Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI and charged with money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. The government alleged that Ulbricht was responsible for facilitating over $1 billion in illegal transactions on Silk Road. The case against Ulbricht was highly public.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting any records related to communication between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and any other relevant agencies, in regard to the investigation of Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am requesting any internal notes or documents related to the investigation of Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case, including any documents related to the joint task force involved in the investigation.\r\n\r\nPlease include any and all records, including but not limited to memos, emails, reports, and any other relevant documents related to the investigation of Ross Ulbricht and the Silk Road case.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
