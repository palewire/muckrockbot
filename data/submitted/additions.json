Any communications sent or received by Kevin Eltife on March 13-14, 2025, inclusive, that relate to or mention any of the following terms: drag shows, drag, Executive Order, Title IX, or Tim O'Hare.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties.
