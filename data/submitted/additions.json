Johnson Space Center (JSC), between the years 2015 and 2017, during which time Mr. Johnson reportedly filmed portions of his film \"Operation Avalanche\" (2016) inside of JSC, claiming he was making a documentary. Since it stands to reason that, even if he lied his way into the facility by claiming to be making a documentary, he would still have to obtain some sort of permission in order to film in restricted locations. Therefore, I additionally request any documentation produced as a result of Mr. Johnson's visit to JSC to film scenes for \"Operation Avalanche.\"\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
