        "communication": "Dear Adam  Steinbaugh, \n\nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2025-60857. \n\nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx, and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \n\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \n\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \n\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \n\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \n \nSincerely, \n\nFOIA Intake\n",

For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social). The Department has previously granted expedited processing to my requests. See, for example, FOID 25-F-2201 (Appeal No. 25-A-2201-A1).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's creation of an \"Academic Libraries Committee\" to determine what educational or academic materials are to be removed from Department institutions.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the information sought will contribute to the public's ability to provide feedback as the Department implements that policy priority. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its officials are currently making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include these articles:\r\n\r\nhttps://apnews.com/article/pentagon-hegseth-dei-library-books-770364ab99591402ddffe8758432ff26\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-05-09/pentagon-dei-academies-library-books-17741389.html\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/pentagon-hegseth-dei-library-books.html\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-orders-military-leaders-to-pull-library-materials-dei/\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/pentagon-dei-gender-ideology-books\r\nhttps://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/10/Pentagon-orders-military-libraries-remove-books-diversity-racism-gender-issues/1041746897357/\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/pentagon-military-academies-review-books\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5293254-pentagon-orders-swift-review-removal-of-library-books-that-address-diversity-anti-racism/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/naval-academy-banned-books.html\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/dei-purge-holocaust-book-maya-angelou-memoir-pulled-from-naval-academy-library/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/02/naval-academy-remove-400-dei-books/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Department itself issued a press release concerning the memo and the Committee, reflecting the Department's recognition that there is a public interest in timely information about it: https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4180537.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Redacted Copy of Shared Record\r\nIf permissible, a redacted copy of any employee-related records provided to Grand River Solutions that reference Kelvin Shivers II, with personally identifying medical information removed to the extent required by law.\r\n\r\nI am also formally requesting that the University of Oregon preserve all records related to my ADA accommodation requests, disability disclosures, civil rights complaints, and any internal or external communications referencing me or these matters.\r\n\r\nThis includes\u2014but is not limited to\u2014records held by the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC), HR/ELR, Workplace ADA, General Counsel, School of Music and Dance, Oregon Bach Festival and any third-party vendors (e.g., Grand River Solutions).\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the public interest. It relates directly to a matter involving potential civil rights violations, ADA-protected accommodations, and government transparency. The requested records concern the treatment of a disabled employee, and their disclosure will contribute to public understanding of institutional compliance with state and federal law.\r\n\r\nAs such, I respectfully request that any fees be waived in accordance with ORS 192.324(5), which permits fee waivers when disclosure is in the public interest and is not primarily for personal benefit.\r\n\r\nThis request is time-sensitive and directly relates to an ongoing civil rights matter.

If you deny any part of this request, please provide a written explanation citing the specific legal exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nPlease note: This request and any related public disclosures constitute legally protected activity under ADA Title V (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203), ORS 659A.109, and the First Amendment. Any adverse action or administrative interference in response to this request may be considered unlawful retaliation and will be documented accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request. I am willing to discuss ways to narrow the scope if necessary to facilitate timely release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",
