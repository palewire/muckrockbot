It only gives the numbers on the tag. He has no way of separating Florida tags from out of state tags. You might consider reaching out to FLOCK directly to see if they can provide the specific data you are looking for. Additionally, the FLOCK reports can only be run in 30 day periods and contain every vehicle that is captured by the cameras which will be in the thousands each month. This is really not the data you are requesting and time to redact thousands of entries for each 30 day period will be extremely time consuming and costly. Since the ALPR cannot determine individual state tags, every tag both in-state and out-of-state that is captured is ran in FLOCK\u2019s database which compares the tag number with NCIC/FCIC data.\r\n\nMajor Johnny Greenwood\r\nDepartment of Administrative Services\r\nPutnam County Sheriff\u2019s Office\r\n130 Orie Griffin Blvd.\r\nPalatka, Florida 32177\r\n(386) 329-0820",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Mira Slovak, listed by the FBI's RIDS Dead List as dying on 6/16/2014 nad having been an anti-Communist Czech defector to the U.S. Per FBI standards and regulations, an FBI file is acceptable proof of death.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI do not know how to make this request more clear. \r\n\r\nYou have closed the request, opened the request, delayed the request, closed, opened, and then requested commercial purpose forms. You have demanded fees that do not seem to be based on actual agency costs and then ignored my inquiries about actual agency costs.  I too am quite confused as to where you are now with this request, however when we get to the end I will count up the entire production installments and if in sum total they match:\r\n\r\n\"a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Bethel School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"\r\n\r\nGREAT!\r\n\r\nif not,\r\n\r\nPROBLEM.\r\n\r\nThat should answer all the questions you could ever have about this request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-Please get back to me with an answer about my email of 10-11-23 questions about actual agency costs.\r\n\r\n",

Are there specific words/terms that should be searched, or is there a particular subject matter you are interested in? Even with the fairly narrow date range, the search could produce a number of records pertaining to a variety of subjects, and the responsive records will have to be reviewed individually for any confidential information that may be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code Chapter 22. In accordance with our fee schedule<https://transparency.uiowa.edu/faqs/public-records-fee-schedule>, we charge a rate of $30/hour, with one hour free, for the time to retrieve, review, and redact records. Please also note that we are processing a high volume of other requests at the moment, and requests for emails generally take longer for us to complete, due to the legal review required.\r\n\r\nPlease also be aware that if the search produces any records pertaining to personnel matters, those would likely be exempt from disclosure based on Iowa Code 22.7(11) (confidential personnel records).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to narrow the scope of your request, or if you want to proceed with your request as written. I will be in touch to let you know if there will be costs for the retrieval/review.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAubree\r\n\r\n\r\nAubree Johnson\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nThe University of Iowa\r\n351 Plaza Centre One\r\nIowa City, IA 52242\r\npublic-records@uiowa.edu<mailto:public-records@uiowa.edu>\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: THIS MESSAGE AND ANY RESPONSE TO IT MAY CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC RECORD, AND THEREFORE, MAY BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH IOWA PUBLIC RECORDS LAW, IOWA CODE CHAPTER 22.",

Superior Court, 19 Cal. App.4th 469, 481 (1993). \u201cWholesale requests for general information to be analyzed, collected and compiled by the responding government entity are not encompassed therein.\u201d Hodai v. City of Tucson, C20141225 (Ariz. Super. Ct. 2014) citing mag Entertainment LLC v. Div. of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067. 1076 (N.J. Sup. Ct., App. Div. 2005).\u00a0 A government agency is not required to respond to an overly broad request that does not seek specific records.\u00a0 Id. at 1074, citing Capitol Info. Assoc. v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985). \r\nIn regards to your request for those who have completed Title IX training for the academic year of 2023-2024, the University does not maintain records as requested.\u00a0 Training takes place within 6 months of hire and then every two years thereafter.\u00a0 See NSHE Handbook, Title 4, Chapter 8, Section 14(A)(2)(b). \r\nHowever, UNLV can report that as of March 26, 2024, 7,296 employees have completed training. If you have any questions, please contact publicrecords@unlv.edu and include the reference number in the subject line. Your request is complete and closed.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request #1422659-000 for FBI records concerning Legion of Doom. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the extra-large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.fbi.gov%2Ffdps-1%2F%40%40search-fdps&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6S2vFgDgOWQqiCCwRvUsZQgDAHF1diXKG5fYH3T12M%3D&reserved=0> | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Ffoia&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uaXvm%2Fg3l2HzET7puRKzFvk4XQEvSW%2FUHofbeKfFAng%3D&reserved=0> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F6A0.23F1CDF0][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]\n",

Gov't Code, which provides that an e-mail address of a member of the public that is provided for the purpose of communicating electronically with a governmental body is confidential and not subject to disclosure.  Additional redactions have been made per The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), where a student's identifying information appears within the records.\r\n\r\nSection 552.275 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a governmental body to establish a reasonable limit, not less than 15 hours for a one month period or 36 hours in a 12 month period, on the amount of time that personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies to a requestor, without recovering the costs attributable to the personnel time related to that requestor. Section 552.275 does not replace or supersede other sections, and it does not preclude a governmental body from charging labor for a request for inspection or copies for which a charge is authorized under other sections of this law.\r\n\r\nKeller ISD has established 15 hours in a one-month period and 36 hours per 12-month period as the reasonable limit on the amount of time personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies without recovering attributable costs. This 12-month period coincides with the District's fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Requestors who exceed the 36-hour time limit in a fiscal year (or 15 hours in one month) shall pay all costs attributable to cost of materials, personnel time, and overhead expenses necessary to comply with the request, even if the requestor intends to only inspect the documents.  For the 2023-2024 fiscal year thus far, the District has spent 1.0 hour(s) responding to requests you have submitted to date (since July 1, 2023) and provided you with the records gathered and compiled as a result.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the District's response to the March 13, 2024 request.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nKeller ISD Public Records\r\nP: 817-744-1000 | F: 817-744-1263\r\nwww.kellerisd.net<http://www.kellerisd.net/>",

Would you possibly be willing to reduce the request to up to 950 pages to move the request into the medium track? You are always welcome to request additional material once a release has been made.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s.

Your\r\nrequest concerns FBI files.\r\n\r\nThis office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration's *operational *records (records created by this\r\nagency).  Your request is for *archival* records (records created by or\r\noriginated in a different agency, but that may have been transferred to the\r\nlegal custody of NARA) to which access is restricted.  Therefore, we have\r\nforwarded it to our *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA*\r\nstaff who handle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number, and respond\r\ndirectly to you.  In the future, if you need to follow up with that office,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives and Records Administration\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Staff (RF)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nBy phone: 301-837-3190\r\nBy fax: 301-837-1864\r\nBy email: specialaccess_foia@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request is below.

If you have\r\nfuture requests for FBI files, please submit them directly to Special\r\nAccess and FOIA at their email address above.  Also, please send all status\r\nupdate requests to the same email address.   It helps to attach any\r\nresponse you received from the FBI telling you the records have been\r\ntransferred to NARA.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia  for information about\r\nwhen and how to file a FOIA request with NARA.

Aranka Heller) (May 19, 1898 \u2013 January 1997)\r\n\r\nEach of these individuals is included in the FBI RIDS Dead List (https://ia803107.us.archive.org/6/items/FBIRIDsDeadList2018/RIDSDeadList-2019.pdf) and inclusion in this list is sufficient to show proof of death.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are preprocessed records available for most, if not all, of these subjects. Please both reprocess these records as previously claimed exemptions may no longer be applicable. Additionally, please perform an additional search for records for each of those subjects, beyond existing preprocessed records. In particular, the FBI should have additional records on Bobby Fischer beyond the 10 pages available in the Vault, as the Vault does not contain records related to several possible interactions between Fischer and the FBI, including any cross-references, anything related to his 1992 indictment, and any records related to his 1972 and 1992 matches with Boris Spassky.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nShreyas Gandlur",

        "communication": "Dear Shreyas Gandler:\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\r\nof August 31, 2020 for records in the custody of the National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration. Your request was received in this office on\r\nSeptember 3, 2020, and assigned FOIA tracking number 64611, interim\r\ntracking number RF-264.\r\n\r\nYou requested FBI records related to the following individuals: Robert\r\n\"Bobby\" James Fischer, Regina Wender Fischer, Hans-Gerhardt Fisher, Paul\r\nFelix Nemenyi, Peter Bjorn Nemenyi, Joan Fischer Targ, Aranka Nemeni\r\n(Aranka Heller).\r\n\r\nWe conducted a search of all available indexes transferred to the National\r\nArchives.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to identify any FBI case files at the National Archives\r\nrelated to Robert \u201cBobby\u201d James Fischer, Aranka Nemenyi (Aranka Heller),\r\nPaul Felix Nemenyi, or Joan Fischer Tar. It is possible that records\r\nrelating to these individuals are still in the custody of the FBI. If you\r\nhave not done so already, you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the FBI\r\nfor a search of their files for records relating to your subjects.\r\nInformation about how to submit a FOIA request with the FBI is available on\r\ntheir website at\r\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/services/records-management/foipa/requesting-fbi-records\r\n.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to locate any files on Hans-Gerhart (Gerardo, Girard,\r\nGerard) Fischer, however, the index indicated there may be documents which\r\nreference that name in file 100-HQ-138643, which is about the Soviet\r\nPurchasing Commission.

As it was closed because I received no response, it was not a denial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have just now noticed your message in FOIAXpress and we will proceed to do a search in this case, although the search will take time as MPD must coordinate with an outside agency to do the search.\r\n\r\nAdditional time will be required to review any records located for responsiveness, and for material that may be exempt from release under the District of Columbia FOIA, and to coordinate with other components or agencies that may have an interest in the disposition of such records.\r\n\r\nNow that this request has been assigned to a FOIA Specialist, please respond directly by e-mail, rather than through the FOIAxpress system.\r\nThanks,\r\nBob Eckert\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\nMPD FOIA Office\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"",

ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\" 2) All emails exchanges-including incoming messages, outgoing messages, forwards, and attachments-between the department's public information and/or media relations staff members and ShotSpotter representatives since January 1, 2021. ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\"\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA search located 94 pages of records, in the attached two files, responsive to this FOIA request.  Upon review, I have determined to withhold portions of the released records pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2), which exempts personal privacy information, the release of which would constitute a(n) (clearly) unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  The withheld information includes names/personal identifiers and other personal privacy information, including that which would lead to the identity of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no charges for FOIA services, in this instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this letter to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office  of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>.  Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Eckert\r\n\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month<https://nationaltoday.com/national-developmental-disabilities-awareness-month-2>.

My request includes:\r\n\r\n-Legislative Documents: I am requesting copies of legislative documents, memoranda, or official notices from around 1945 that detail the authorization for school districts to use public funds for NYSSBA membership dues. This includes any legislative acts or amendments specifically enabling such expenditures.\r\n\r\n-Official Correspondence: I seek any official correspondence between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and NYSSBA, dating from 1945 to the current day, which discusses or references the legal basis for using public funds for NYSSBA dues.\r\n\r\n-Policy Documents: I am interested in obtaining any policy documents, guidelines, or bulletins issued by NYSED that address or relate to the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\nI recognize the importance of making my request specific and actionable. This request is aimed at accessing existing, identifiable records without requiring your department to undertake legal interpretation or generate new documentation.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the timeframe specified in my request, spanning from 1945 to the present, may present a broad scope that could potentially place an undue burden on your department. Therefore, I would like to emphasize my openness to partial responses. If locating documents from the entire period specified proves to be overly burdensome, I kindly request that the department prioritize the search and provision of documents from the following more focused timeframes, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n-Documents from the year 1945/1946 itself, given its specific mention in the context of providing legal foundation for school districts' expenditures on NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\n-Key documents from significant legislative or policy milestones related to this matter, should they be readily identifiable by your department.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to balance the need for thoroughness with practical considerations regarding the volume of records and the effort required to retrieve them. My goal is to facilitate a manageable and effective search process that aligns with both our interests in accessing relevant public records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if during the process of fulfilling this request, specific documents are identified that would substantially respond to the core of my inquiry, I am amenable to narrowing the scope further based on your suggestions. Your expertise and understanding of the department's records could provide valuable guidance in focusing this request more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Specifically, you request copies of any records that \"could provide clarification and documentation\" of the statute, including legislative documents, policy documents, and official correspondence.\r\n\r\nA diligent search was made for records responsive to your request, and the following records were located and copied:\r\n\r\n[1.] Governor's \"bill jacket\" for Laws of 1945, Chapter 92 (in State Archives record series 12950), which enacted what is now Education Law sect. 1618. The bill jacket contains a copy of the bill that was enacted, as well as comments on the bill. The jacket has been scanned, and a link to the digital file will be transmitted to you in a separate e-mail.\r\n\r\n[2.] Legal opinions of the Commissioner of Education relating to sect. 1618, found in 1 Education Department Reports 718 and 5 Education Department Reports 232. Digital copies of those published opinions are attached.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that after a diligent search, no \"policy documents\" or \"official correspondence\" concerning sect. 1618 were found in the correspondence and subject files of the Commissioner of Education that have been transferred to the State Archives by the State Education Department. Under my direction, staff searched the Commissioner's correspondence and subject files dating from 1945 through 2014, and no documents responsive to your request were located. More recent subject and correspondence files have not been transferred to the Archives.\r\n\r\nBecause no policy documents or official correspondence were located, you may appeal this partial denial of your request by sending a letter within thirty (30) days to Dr. Betty Rosa, Commissioner of Education, New York State Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12234.

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",
