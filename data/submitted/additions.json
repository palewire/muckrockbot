While it is my understanding the Paperwork Reduction Act does not necessarily require publishing changes sought from OMB, it is difficult, if not impossible, to making meaningful public comments to OMB about the proposed changes.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Education claims the proposed changes will decrease the public burden by OVER TWO MILLION HOURS. This is a substantial change. Therefore, I am requesting a fee waiver, as the Department of Education press release states, but does not specify, vague policy changes. It is in the public interest to understand these policy changes, how it may impact public burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and how other organizations who rely on the FAFSA, including state universities, will be affected by these changes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
