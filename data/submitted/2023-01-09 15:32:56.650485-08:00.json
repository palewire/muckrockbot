Based upon an initial review of your request, and an estimate of what is required to complete it, this agency has determined that it will be unable to respond to your request in full within the next twenty (20) business days.  The reasons we cannot process your request within the next twenty (20) business days include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The volume of the requests we received prior to yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The work needed to process said requests,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that this agency processes requests in the order in which they are received,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The anticipated size of the files from which you have requested records,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The fact that the records you requested may not be contained within a single, readily identifiable, on-site source, and, most significantly,\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

See Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454, 465 (2007) ([T]ime needed to comply with a request may be dependent on a number of factors, including the volume of the request and the retrieval methods.  Compliance with FOIL request may require substantial time and may not require agency to provide such records in a time other than that which is reasonable in view of the attendant circumstances).  In the determination any statutorily authorized fees incurred in processing your request will be listed.  These fees must be paid before this agency will release any records.  Pub Off. L. \u00a7 87(1)(b)(iii).\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive a determination by that the date set forth above, please do not hesitate to contact us.
