These jurisdictions are: Richmond, Chesterfield , Prince William County, Fairfax County, Virginia Beach and Loudon County. We are requesting four data points for each case- the jurisdiction, the reimbursement amount, the associated case number, and the date of reimbursement. We are not requesting defendant name, attorney name, or any address information. If possible, we would request this data be stored in a spreadsheet if the applicable database is capable of exporting to a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The investigation may have been conducted by the Tampa field office, with lead investigator Justin Deutsch.\r\n\r\nHere is the article referencing the investigation.\r\n\r\nhttps://tonyortega.org/2012/12/13/homeland-security-investigating-scientology-for-human-trafficking/\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request was rejected on the grounds that I could not demonstrate that disclosure of the requested records to me would constitute a \"significant\" benefit to public knowledge of NASA'a activities. Specifically, my claim was characterized as \"speculative.\" In considering my appeal, I ask whomever it may concern to consider that, in addition to my qualifications as stated in the original request, I am the editor-in-chief of a magazine (currently digital but soon to be in print) called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" and I personally contributed an article to this magazine on NASA's relationship to Hollywood--an almost unexplored topic. So it seems arbitrary to conclude that this information will not benefit public awareness in a \"significant\" way. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for considering my appeal,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
