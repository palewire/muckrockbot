        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

Additionally, as we are producing the records electronically, there are no duplication fees.  Therefore, given your status as \"All Other\", no fee waiver is necessary, and your request for one is moot.  You will not be charged for any portion of FOIA processing fees. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.117(d)(2)(iv). \r\n\r\nPlease consult our website at https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/freedom-of-information-act-foia/foia-reference-guide for more information about the FOIA and the NLRB FOIA regulations.

        "communication": "Lara Nochomovitz \r\nN/A \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR143067 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-18407 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/21/2023.  You have requested all policy (formal or informal) documents related on how ICE/CBP decides to grant/deny parole to a detained immigrant encountered near the border. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy (ORAP) for records responsive to your request produced 14 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 14 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAngela Flores \r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t14 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

Both Eppolito and Caracappa are widely reported as deceased (please see the attached report of the New York Daily News). As such, there are no longer privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7, nor are there any privacy concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Eppolito:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 129-36\r\nBOP Registration Number: 04596-748\r\nDate of Birth: 7/22/48\r\nDate of Death: 11/03/2019\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Caracappa:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 115-32\r\nBOP Register Number: 04597-748\r\nDate of Birth: 11/12/41\r\nDate of Death: 04/08/2017\r\n\r\nPlease return a result for a query of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS) using each aforementioned subject's name and (where necessary) accompanying identifying numbers or dates of birth. \r\n\r\nPlease return both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies, across all systems of records. This includes records within the following systems of records (not exclusively): Automated Intelligence Records System (Pathfinder); Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS); Grants of Confidentiality Files (GCF); Operations Files; and Security Files.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the DEA has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

        "communication": "Mrs. Starr, Jupiter Police Department,\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phones from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, It is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or a unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (ie call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

You incorrectly suggested that the Town had not provided you the information necessary to access those records\u2014we had\u2014and requested that the records either be uploaded to a website unknown to the Town or provided as an email attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the size/volume of your responsive documents, providing them via email is not a viable option. Further, the Town will not deviate from its standard procedures and upload records to an unknown third-party website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any event, we note that as of 10/31/2024, you had accessed and downloaded the responsive records produced to you on 10/16/24. If this is incorrect, we again remind you that you can create your own username and password for the file transfer site so that you can access the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to access the Town\u2019s file transfer site, the responsive documents can alternatively be burned to a disc and picked up in person at the Jupiter Police Department.\r\n\r\n\u200bRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:44f39992-31b4-4f0a-99b9-fefbb9edde92]<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.jupiter.fl.us%2f&c=E,1,_5S1lqS7CtguFkStARSlhAuYt_miT_eYrqEFvXblY_9dIRn7ijT95pA65yPN4MlI3E7T3avPU3YIVpfqf6KwniNfS0w6OeNS_6cVRtB8w3gPW9o,&typo=1>[cid:f274a37b-290e-45c8-9976-a368e0b07f54]\r\n\r\n\r\nMagdalena Rogers\r\n\r\nRecords Manager\r\n\r\nPhone: 561 741 2253\r\n\r\nFax: 561 746 4545\r\n\r\nEmail: 1188@jupiter.fl.us\r\n\r\n196 Military Trail,\r\n\r\nJupiter, Florida 33458\r\n\r\n*****CONFIDENTIAL*****\r\nThe information in this email is intended specifically for the person(s) to which it is addresses and does contain confidential, EXEMPT information from F.S.S 119 (Florida Public Records Law), and/or otherwise privileged material.

The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Nuclear Regulatory Commission's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We are currently experiencing a high volume of open requests (there are currently 1,370 open requests) and many require additional research such as yours. We are interpreting this request as email records related to the provided domain and therefore we will conduct email search for records from January 1, 2021 through August 30, 2023 with the keywords: @clearview.ai @mg.clearview.ai Please let me know by September 21, 2023, if this clarification is incorrect.\u00a0 If we do not hear from you by then, we will proceed our research with these search parameters. Once we have identified the records we will begin reviewing and preparing them for release. We anticipate our first installment of records to you on or before November 1, 2023 . If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know. If we are able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly do so. \r\nYour request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120 . Please visit our website  and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide.

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause this installment of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments\r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, no installments have gone unclaimed.

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 17th and 18th were sent on 03/29/2024 and 4/19/2024 respectively, neither of which have been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause these installments of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989).
