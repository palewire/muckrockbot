Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll video recorded in a series of September 2018 drone flights near Point Lay, Alaska that sought to conduct a walrus survey.  Remote pilot is Anthon Fischbein.  The RIDs are listed as:\r\n\r\n  *   RID 18-4161\r\n  *   RID 18-4160\r\n  *   RID 18-4159\r\n  *   RID 18-4158\r\n  *   RID 18-4157\r\n  *   RID 18-4140\r\n  *   RID 18-4138\r\n  *   RID 18-4135\r\n  *   RID 18-4133\r\n  *   RID 18-4141\r\n  *   RID 18-4137\r\n  *   RID 18-4136\r\n  *   RID 18-4134\r\n  *   RID 18-4139\r\n  *   RID 18-4095\r\n  *   RID 18-4094\r\n  *   RID 18-4090\r\n  *   RID 18-4093\r\n  *   RID 18-4092\r\n  *   RID 18-4091\r\n  *   RID 18-4043\r\n  *   RID 18-4042\r\n  *   RID 18-4031\r\n  *   RID 18-4030\r\n  *   RID 18-4026\r\n  *   RID 18-4025\r\n  *   RID 18-4014\r\n  *   RID 18-3986\r\n  *   RID 18-3985\r\n  *   RID 18-3984\r\n  *   RID 18-3960\r\n  *   RID 18-3959\r\n  *   RID 18-3962\r\n  *   RID 18-3961\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/part-2#2.39>.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g)<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/part-2#2.37>.\r\n\r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200.00 for the processing of your request.  If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges. You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track.  There are 12 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue.  Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by July 25, 2023.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov<mailto:foia@usgs.gov>.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requests and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:  (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:  (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:  1 (877) 684-6448\r\nEmail:  ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:  https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department's FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.\r\n\r\nContact information for the Department's FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact me by email at foia@usgs.gov<mailto:foia@usgs.gov> or jewilson@usgs.gov<mailto:jewilson@usgs.gov>.

Dear Forest Gregg, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on July 17, 2023. You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nthe transition book, report, or memo that the Lightfoot administration prepared for then Mayor-Elect Johnson \r\n\r\nthe document or documents will be similar to the transition report that the Daley administration prepared for then Mayor-Elect Emmanuel: https://www.civicfed.org/sites/default/files/DaleyTransitionReport.pdf \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nForest Gregg \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmayors-office-885%252Ftransition-book-from-the-lightfoot-administration-to-mayor-elect-johnson-149332%252F%253Femail%253DMOfoia%252540cityofchicago.org&url_auth_token=AAAVakss4kqDBu4naYY4htHES6U%3A1qLa2o%3AvB8wAqSJ8cIYRmJbGVRPgZHpKLkF98HlVqWdZWpH9Nw\" \r\nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. \r\nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\nPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. \r\n\r\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the deliberative process exemption under FOIA focuses on documents that reflect \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d NLRB v. Sears and Roebuck, 421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975).\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage \u201cfrank discussion of legal or policy matters\u201d such that employees in government feel free to express their opinions before a final legal or policy decision is made. \u201cDeliberative\u201d has been found to mean being a direct part of the process where recommendations and opinions are expressed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Records where preliminary opinions are expressed and policies and actions are formulated are therefore exempt from production under Section 7(1)(f) of the Illinois FOIA, and have been properly withheld. \r\nYou have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844. Sincerely, Thomas Skelton \r\nFOIA Officer \r\nMayor's Office",

Because this is a public procurement process, the public has a strong interest in full transparency into this process and conversations that are happening between public officials such as the police and any vendors they are considering working with. \r\n\r\n3) How do you or your organization intend to disseminate the information to the wider public?\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the documents we will determine if they warrant coverage through some sort of journalistic work including but not limited to written articles, podcasts, or videos. \r\n\r\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning or describing Terence Hallinan (December 4, 1936 \u2013 January\r\n    17, 2020), who was an American attorney and politician from San Francisco,\r\n    California.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
