Richard Allen was convicted and sentenced October 31st 2024 and the judge assured that after the gag order was lifted at sentencing trial exhibits would be made public as the transcript is being prepared.

Indiana Public Records Act \"APRA\" Indiana Code 5-14-3 et seq requires these exhibits to be made public. Considering the volumne of these exhibits some delay is understandable. Four months is no longer understandable and the excuses given to the media who have requested them are ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
