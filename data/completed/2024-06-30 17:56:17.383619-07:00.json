        "communication": "I am not requesting the name or address of the subject property owner, only the appraised value and taxation amount as well as the Property Improvements that are taxed on this property, you are more than welcome to redact the name and address of the owner of the property. If you still feel you are unable to complete this Request, please request an Attorney General Opinion as required by law. Below is the statue for reference along with the requirements for withholding information.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n-B\r\n\r\nA. \r\nDuties of the Governmental Body and of the Attorney General Under \r\nSubchapter G \r\nSections 552.301, 552.302, and 552.303 of the Government Code set out the duty of a \r\ngovernmental body to seek the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether information is excepted \r\nfrom disclosure to the public. \r\nSection 552.301, subsections (a) and (b), provides that when a governmental body receives a \r\nwritten request for information the governmental body wishes to withhold, it must seek an attorney \r\ngeneral decision within ten business days of its receipt of the request and state the exceptions to \r\ndisclosure that it believes are applicable.  Subsections (a) and (b) read: \r\n(a) A governmental body that receives a written request for information that it wishes \r\nto withhold from public disclosure and that it considers to be within one of the \r\nexceptions under Subchapter C must ask for a decision from the attorney general \r\nabout whether the information is within that exception if there has not been a \r\nprevious determination about whether the information falls within one of the \r\nexceptions. \r\n. . . \r\n(b) The governmental body must ask for the attorney general\u2019s decision and state the \r\nexceptions that apply within a reasonable time but not later than the 10th business \r\nday after the date of receiving the written request. \r\nThus, a governmental body that wishes to withhold information from the public on the ground of \r\nan exception generally must seek the decision of the attorney general as to the applicability of that \r\nexception.144  In addition, an entity contending that it is not subject to the Act may timely request \r\na decision from the attorney general to avoid the consequences of noncompliance if the entity is \r\ndetermined to be subject to the Act.145  Therefore, when requesting such a decision, the entity \r\n\r\nshould not only present its arguments as to why it is not subject to the Act, but should also raise \r\nany exceptions to required disclosure it believes apply to the requested information. \r\nA governmental body need not request an attorney general decision if there has been a previous \r\ndetermination that the requested material falls within one of the exceptions to disclosure.146  What \r\nconstitutes a \u201cprevious determination\u201d is narrow in scope, and governmental bodies are cautioned \r\nagainst treating most published attorney general decisions as \u201cprevious determinations\u201d to avoid \r\nthe requirements of section 552.301(a).  The attorney general has determined that there are two \r\ntypes of previous determinations.147  The first and by far the most common instance of a previous \r\ndetermination pertains to specific information that is again requested from a governmental body \r\nwhen the attorney general has previously issued a decision that evaluates the public availability of \r\nthe precise information or records at issue.  This first instance of a previous determination does \r\nnot apply to records that are substantially similar to records previously submitted to the attorney \r\ngeneral for review, nor does it apply to information that may fall within the same category as any \r\ngiven records on which the attorney general has previously ruled.  The first type of previous \r\ndetermination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue is precisely the same information that was previously submitted to \r\nthe attorney general pursuant to section 552.301(e)(1)(D) of the Government Code; \r\n2. the governmental body that received the request for the information is the same \r\ngovernmental body that previously requested and received a ruling from the attorney \r\ngeneral; \r\n3. the attorney general\u2019s prior ruling concluded the precise information is or is not excepted \r\nfrom disclosure under the Act; and \r\n4. the law, facts, and circumstances on which the prior attorney general ruling was based have \r\nnot changed since the issuance of the ruling.148 \r\nAbsent all four of the above criteria, and unless the second type of previous determination applies, \r\na governmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nfrom the public information that is requested under the Act. \r\nThe second type of previous determination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue falls within a specific, clearly delineated category of information \r\nabout which the attorney general has previously rendered a decision;\r\n2. the previous decision is applicable to the particular governmental body or type of \r\ngovernmental body from which the information is requested;149 \r\n3. the previous decision concludes the specific, clearly delineated category of information is \r\nor is not excepted from disclosure under the Act; \r\n4. the elements of law, fact, and circumstances are met to support the previous decision\u2019s \r\nconclusion that the requested records or information at issue is or is not excepted from \r\nrequired disclosure; and150 \r\n5. the previous decision explicitly provides that the governmental body or bodies to which \r\nthe decision applies may withhold the information without the necessity of again seeking \r\na decision from the attorney general. \r\nAbsent all five of the above criteria, and unless the first type of previous determination applies, a \r\ngovernmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nrequested information from the public under the Act.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n(b)  Information in appraisal records under Section 25.02 is confidential and is available only for the official use of the appraisal district, this state, the comptroller, and taxing units and political subdivisions of this state if:\r\n(1)  the information identifies the home address of a named individual to whom this section applies; and\r\n(2)  the individual:\r\n\r\n(A)  chooses to restrict public access to the information on the form prescribed for that purpose by the comptroller under Section 5.07; or\r\n\r\n(B)  is a federal or state judge, or the spouse of a federal or state judge, beginning on the date the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System notifies the appraisal district of the judge's qualification for the judge's office.\r\n(c)  A choice made under Subsection (b) remains valid until rescinded in writing by the individual.\r\n(d)  This section does not prohibit the public disclosure of information in appraisal records that identifies property according to an address if the information does not identify an individual who has made an election under Subsection (b) in connection with the individual's address.\r\n",

ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nA search of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 1 page that is responsive to your request.  ICE has determined that 1 page will be released in their entirety; ICE has claimed no deletions or exemptions. All PREA audit reports are posted to the public ICE FOIA Library. Please review these reports at www.ice.gov/foia/library. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \n\nEnclosure(s):\t 1 page(s)",

As a preliminary matter, your request is overly broad and will need refining in order to perform a search.\r\n\r\nWe do not have the ability to perform a broad, agency-wide search of all email accounts under the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture, including all staff. We would like to narrow the request to specific record custodians, if possible.  Would you be amenable to limiting your request to a search of specific named custodians accounts under the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture? With that narrowing, we would be able to proceed with processing of your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss narrowing your request, please feel free to reach out by email or at the number below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAA864.614AD0E0]\r\nOlga Colacicco\r\nFOIA Analyst Contractor\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n1400 Independence Ave., SW\r\nWashington, DC  20250\r\n\u260e   (202) 690-5037\r\n\u2709   olga.colacicco@usda.gov<mailto:roman.vayner@usda.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

        "communication": "Dear Julieta Cardenas:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on May 23, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nOnce we initiate processing, a search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case Number, 2024-OSEC-04821-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Olga Colacicco by email at olga.colacicco@usda.gov<mailto:olga.colacicco@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov%20>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients. Any unauthorized interception of this message or the use or disclosure of the information it contains may violate the law and subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties.

The grounds for appeal are as follows:\r\n\r\n(b)(1): All records returned are older than the 25 years. Related redactions should be reconsidered in light of automatic declassification policies per Executive Order 13526.  \r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C): By context, I believe names of persons that have been redacted for reasons of privacy are in fact known to be deceased. Such deceased persons have diminished privacy interests, which are outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.  \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is for the request to be remanded with instructions for the following:\r\n\r\n1) To review classified records with the presumption that records older than 25 years are declassified by default. \r\n\r\n2) To review the records, cross referencing names against the RIDS Dead List; where an individual named is in fact known to be deceased, redaction should be removed. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nT.

Proof of death is not required as her death was widely reported: https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/30/ellen-tauscher-dead-at-67-1293104.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

It also does not require the\r\ndistrict to manipulate or analyze existing information in a new way to respond to a request. CORA Reimbursement Policy\u00a0\u2010 \r\nThe Colorado Open Records Act allows for the following reimbursement for reasonable costs\r\nassociated with completing a request: \r\n \r\n  * Copying Expenses: We charge $0.25 for each hard\u2010copy page after the first 25 pages. \r\n  * Staff Time: For requests that require more than one hour of staff time, we charge $33.58 for\r\n    each additional hour of staff time expended. \r\n  * There will be a retrieval charge for documents stored at an offsite facility, dependent on the\r\n    number of boxes to be retrieved. \r\n  * Electronically stored files which are larger than 14MB will be transferred to a CD for a charge of\r\n    $10 per CD. \r\nYou can read more about the District\u2019s CORA Policy \r\n You will receive an email when your request has been completed.",

Please log in to the CORA Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records. We found the check. CORA Records Request - R000453-060324  NOTE: Denver Public Schools uses the Facebook moderator to block certain keywords. Keywords that might be inappropriate\u00a0or discriminatory for example. All hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by the DPS social media team\u00a0and often unhidden because the Facebook Moderator might have blocked it for an odd reason. A key example of this is a comment that says, \"Happy Pride Month!\" This comment was blocked because it has an exclamation point then unblocked by a human on the DPS social media team. Again, all hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by a DPS employee. \r\nAn oversight of the words that are blocked on the Facebook Moderator is the exclamation sign. Therefore any post that has \"!\" would have been hidden by the Facebook Moderator, then unhidden by the DPS social media team. This has since been changed. \r\nAlso of note, comments blocked by the\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Moderator, then unhidden by a DPS employee, did not show up on this report. \r\nDPS operates with a social media policy that does not allow for bullying, use of slurs, use of profanity, or words and comments that violate our values. \r\nSincerely, STACY WHEELER \r\nCORA Officer",

Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act. In your request dated April 29, 2024 you sought information related to date of stop, time of stop, race of driver, gender of driver, age of driver, if search occurred, if contraband was found, anonymized officer ID, and stop location for all years available. This is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712, et seq. The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute does not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. I have attached the available data we were able to pull from our database to the portal attachment tab for your refereence. There are random blanks for race, gender, and location in the data. All fields are supposed to be filled out, however, based on my experience with drop down boxes on our cruiser computers, the occassional clerical error can occur as the information doesn't always populate from the drop down menu. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this. Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience in my response to this request. If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.5259.",

Records that show all CPS incidents that included a student referral to law enforcement, including school-based resource officers, the underlying offense, the result of each referral, such as arrest or ticket/citation for municipal ordinance violation, and the gender, race, disability status and ELL status of the students who were referred for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 school years. Please also include the school in the data breakdown. The records could include, but not be limited to, disciplinary logs or reports, incident logs or reports, behavior resolution reports, and data that reflects the referrals, arrests and citations during the above years. \r\n2. The number of arrests of students on CPS property from July 1, 2021 to current broken down by CPS property name and address. Please break this data down by age of arrestee. RESPONSE : A portion of the information you seek can be found online. Please visit the CPS data website which includes police notification information: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ . Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the spreadsheets beside the \u201cSuspensions and Expulsions\u201d header. \r\nBe advised that you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) for \u201carrests of students\u201d information at the following website: https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-cpd/freedom-of-information-act-foia/ . \r\nPursuant to 5 ILCS 140/8.5: Records maintained online. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, to the contrary, a public body is not required to copy a public record that is published on the public body\u2019s website. The public body shall notify the requester that the public record is available online and direct the requester to the website where the record can be reasonably accessed. \r\nAs to the remainder of your request, be advised that the CPS FOIA office has determined that it does not properly identify a document(s) for search and would require a CPS FOIA Officer to conduct research and create a new record. To search for the information you seek in the manner requested, a FOIA Officer would need to go to various departments, research, create a list of possible responsive records, and answer questions, which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. \r\nUnder the Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nFurther, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We are not the records custodian for that office, and will only have responsive records to the extent that such records were sent to or from the Office of the Governor.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to the extent we have responsive records, we will endeavor to respond to your request. I have broken out our responses/requests for clarification below, corresponding to the separate items in your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nWe do not have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. First, there are no search terms or keywords identified for this request. Second, the request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" Interpreted literally and applied to the Office of the Governor, this would essentially cover every email sent to or from our office to any state employee, regardless of subject or keywords. This is likely to return thousands of documents and incur significant costs. Please confirm whether this is the intended scope of your request.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. Similar to part (2), this request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" With the inclusion of the specified keywords, there are likely to be somewhat fewer responsive documents, but I am not sure whether this is the intended scope.\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo the extent that this request was intended to cover only communications between employees of or persons associated with the University of Georgia, on the one hand, and the Office of the Governor, on the other, the responsive records would be identical to those provided to you on May 8th (attached).\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\nThere is no request following \"4\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like us to interpret this request, and if you wish, provide any additional clarification to your request. We can then provide you an estimate of the response time or the fees, if any.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Hatcher\r\n\r\nDeputy Executive Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice of Governor Brian P.

Please do not reply to this e-mail. ***\r\nThank you for submitting your open records request under the Public Information Act (PIA) to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Your request has been forwarded to the PUC\u2019s Public Information Coordinator. The Public Information Coordinator will address PIA requests in the order they are received, but in all cases within the time prescribed by law.\r\nTime To Respond\r\nWe will promptly respond to your request by providing the requested information, informing you there is no responsive information, or notifying you all or a portion of the requested information falls under an exception to public disclosure and requires a ruling from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG). If the requested information does not fall under an exception to public disclosure but will take longer than 10 business days to produce, we will notify you of the date and time the information will be provided.\r\nRequest for Clarification\r\nYou can help us respond more quickly to your request by ensuring that your request is clear, specific, and requests only the information you wish to receive. We do our best to relate requests to the information we have and do not require records to be requested by their specific names, but if you know the specific name of the record you are requesting, it will help us respond more efficiently.\r\nIf your request is vague or overly broad, we may, in compliance with Texas Government Code \u00a7 552.222, request clarification in order to ensure we understand what information you are requesting.  Also, please keep in mind that we are not required under the PIA to create new information, do legal research, or answer questions.  See Open Records Decision Nos. 555 and 563 at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/open-records-decisions.\r\nWithholding Information\r\nAlthough the PIA makes most government information available to the public, some exceptions exist. If we believe an exception applies, we will notify you that the information cannot be released and request a ruling from the OAG.\r\nCosts\r\nYou may be charged for costs associated with responding to your request.  Personnel time is charged at $15 per hour, plus 20% of the personnel charge for overhead. There is also a charge of $0.10 per page, plus personnel time, if the request exceeds fifty pages, plus postage. These rates are set by the OAG.  You can find more information regarding costs associated with PIA requests here: https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=4&ti=1&pt=3&ch=70&rl=Y.\r\nFor more information regarding access to public information held by the PUC, please visit our website at https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/contact/PIA.aspx.\r\n\r\nYou may also find more detailed information regarding the PIA in Texas Government Code Chapter 552 or on the OAG\u2019s website at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/members-public.\n",

The request does not duplicate a major category of records, and does not seek \"all records containing particular words\" or \"every report filed with the public office for a particular time period\". My request asked for only specific reports during a specific time span, and only for records that were pertaining to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nSince you disagreed as to the narrowness of that request, allow me to modify the request to be even more specific and provide additional information to help you ascertain which records are responsive:\r\n\r\nA copy of any PDF, Word Document, InDesign Document, and/or email, received by COTA's Office of the President, which was originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard, received in the years 2020 or 2021, containing or about a particular report, hereinafter referred to as \"the report\". The report is the final report in a study which was commissioned by COTA, which explored various ways to fund the portion of COTA's budget which is currently sourced from passenger fares, in the event that COTA decided to make passenger fares free. The report was commissioned about three years ago (2018-2020) and completed about a year later (2020-2021). The study and report were paid for in part using COTA funds. The report may be referred to as \"the Ice Miller report\" in casual usage. I am interested in the final report document, in whatever format it was provided in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know whether you require additional detail to identify this report.",

        "communication": "Hi Nicole,\r\n\r\nI disagree with your characterization of my request as \"ambiguous and overly broad\" as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"all records containing particular words\" - This request is for a specific report with an identified subject matter, not \"all records\" containing particular words.  \r\n2. \"duplication for all records having to do with a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report pertaining to a particular topic, not all records pertaining to that topic.  \r\n3. \"all records of a particular type\" - This request is for a specific report in whatever format it may be in, not all records of a particular type or format.  \r\n4. \"all emails sent or received by a particular email address with no subject matter or time limitation\" - This request is for a specific report. In the event that that report may have been transmitted by email, the email is identified with subject matter and time limitations.  \r\n5. \"all documents which document any and all instances of a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report, with certain identifying characteristics noted in the request. This is not a request for all documents which discuss this report's topic.  \r\n6. \"discovery-style requests that seek all records relating to or reflecting certain types of information\" - This request is limited by date range, the name of the report's author, the report's subject matter, and the type of document containing the report. This is a request for a specific report. It is not a discovery-style request.   \r\n\r\nBelow, I have rephrased my request in order to make it clearer which records I am requesting. I have also included additional information about the requested record, which further narrows the scope of the request.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of a report in COTA's possession. The report has all of the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Prepared by Ice Miller or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n2. Originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n3. Received by COTA in December 2022 or in January 2021\r\n4. Titled \"Fare-Free Transit Analysis\" or with similar words\r\n5. With a subject matter of free public transportation or fare-free transit\r\n6. Commissioned by COTA, and paid for in some part using COTA funds\r\n\r\nThe following details are provided to help you in your search, but the requested document may not meet all or any of these characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. The report may have been attached to an email from Michael.Coleman@icemiller.com or from an @icemiller.com email address\r\n2. The email or report may be dated December 4, 2020, or later\r\n3. The email or report may mention Robert Miller, a past COTA Board member\r\n4. The report may have been included in an email sent to Joanna Pinkerton, to PinkertonJM@cota.com, to another COTA employee in the COTA Office of the President at that time, to Terry Foegler, and/or to Sophia Mohr\r\n\r\nIn the event that multiple versions of the report are discovered, I request the final version of the report. In the event that the report is available in multiple formats, I request the digital version of the PDF, Word Document, or other original document(s) sent to COTA. In the event that the report is split across multiple files or documents (such as a cover letter, a slide deck, and appendices), I request those documents which are necessary to compile the complete report. In the event that the report was submitted by electronic mail to COTA, I also request a copy of the email that was used to send the files comprising the report, in addition to the report files themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this information is still insufficient to identify the responsive records, then pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(2) I request a copy of COTA's document retention schedule, and information on the manner in which records are retained by COTA and its Office of the President and accessed in the ordinary course of the office's duties.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Keith",

Please\r\nrefer to this number should you have any questions concerning your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have placed you in the News Media category for fee purposes, which means\r\nyou are obligated to pay all duplication costs after the first 100 pages.\r\nIn addition, a fee agreement is the amount you would give consent to pay\r\nassociated with the processing of a request for information.  In the future,\r\nalong with your request for information, it will be necessary for you to\r\nsubmit a fee agreement stating the costs you are willing to incur before\r\nyour request can continue to be processed. Upon receipt of your fee\r\nagreement, your request would then be processed in accordance with\r\nprocedural requirements promulgated in Department of Defense (DoD)\r\nRegulation 5400.07, which is available on the internet at\r\n<https://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/FOIA/FOIA_Resources/DoDM%2054\r\n00.07.pdf?ver=2017-03-15-135646-847>\r\nhttps://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/FOIA/FOIA_Resources/DoDM%20540\r\n0.07.pdf?ver=2017-03-15-135646-847.  If we believe processing fees would\r\nexceed your cost agreement, we would advise.

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n\r\n1) All policies, procedures, memorandums of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, any other sort of agreement, and all related directive materials regarding the transfer of incarcerated persons between different facilities within New York state. \r\n\r\n2) From 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2021 specifically: all documents, papers, letters, email correspondence, memoranda, training materials, presentations, directives, guidance, press releases, or other communications (both internal and external) about transfers and COVID-19. This includes \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss transfer procedures and mention COVID-19, health precautions, and/or respiratory illness. It also includes (but is not limited to) any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss changes to the frequency of transfers in response to the virus (e.g., halting transfers, minimizing transfers, transferring at-risk incarcerated people, etc.). \r\n\r\n3) Any contracts or agreements regarding inter-prison transfers, including but not limited to a contract with a private transfer company, vehicle purchasing or leasing, and so on.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON DEFINITION: By inter-prison transfer, I am referring to any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility,\u201d as recorded in DOCCS\u2019s \u201cIncarcerated Lookup\u201d database. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. If the records provided refer to movements more broadly than this definition of transfers, that is acceptable and please send them. However, if there are records that refer ONLY to types of movements that would not include inter-prison transfers as defined here, they fall outside of this request. If there is any question about this, please feel free to reach out and I am happy to clarify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
