There are only a few listed on your website, yet your website and the Alumni Agencies material indicate there are a number of them available, and even for the Alumni Agencies-funded scholarships, VMI makes or participates in the selections. This makes the information releasable under the FOIA.  If there is a website that lists these, I am willing to pull them from there, but unlike almost every other Virginia IHE, VMI does not have an easily locatable source for this information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
