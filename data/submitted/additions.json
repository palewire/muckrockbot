        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to documents held by the National Security Agency (NSA) related to the monitoring or analysis of internet memes.\r\n\r\nAs internet memes become an increasingly popular form of communication on social media and other online platforms, there have been concerns about governments and political campaigns using them to influence public opinion. It is important to understand how the NSA may be monitoring or analyzing these memes in order to protect privacy and civil liberties.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's monitoring or analysis of internet memes, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this monitoring or analysis. Additionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's use of internet memes for any purpose, including propaganda or disinformation campaigns.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any records related to the ELSUR program, XKeyscore program, metadata collection, or any other related programs that may be used for monitoring internet traffic and communications.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the NSA can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the NSA to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records related to surveillance and monitoring. One key case is United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), which held that the FOIA reflects a \"general philosophy of full agency disclosure\" and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Electronic Privacy Information Center v. National Security Agency, 678 F.3d 926 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which held that the NSA must release information related to the agency's monitoring of internet traffic and communications.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the development and implementation of this program, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to the program.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Polk County Sheriff's Office's training and procedures for dealing with individuals with autism, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this training or procedures.
