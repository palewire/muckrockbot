But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

A log of all emails to/from the CPS Title IX Officer, Camie Pratt, from May 1, 2024 - May 15, 2024. Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\n\r\n2. Calendars for Camie Pratt, from January 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. \r\n\r\n3. Copies of reports filed via this link ( https://cps.guardianconduct.com/incident-reporting ) from April 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. RESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed your request and determined that, as currently written, it is unduly burdensome beyond the public interest in seeking numerous records maintained in multiple locations and which contain highly sensitive and exempt information that would require a timely and careful review. In order to respond to this request, the CPS FOIA Office would first be required to separately gather the requested calendar exports, gather all requested reports, and conduct an eDiscovery search to produce the requested email log. The FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,995 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Title IX Officer\u2019s email account without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line content will contain, and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain, student information, information reflecting the identity of parents communicating with their child\u2019s school, the identity of employees reporting Title IX matters, the identity of witnesses cooperating with Title IX investigations, details of pending investigations, exempt details of communications between a public body and its attorney, and personal email addresses or other highly personal information, which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,995 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves and consultation with the Title IX Office in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Further, CPS receives hundreds of reports submitted via the link referenced in the request every month, and which are used to \u201creport an allegation of sex/gender-based discrimination, sex/gender-based harassment, sexual harassment (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking), sexual misconduct, [] retaliation \u2026 incidents of race, color, or national origin discrimination, discrimination based on another protected category, Bias Based Harm, Staff to Student Physical Abuse or Corporal Punishment, Retaliation, or Sports Inequity.\u201d Accordingly, producing five months\u2019 of the CPS Title IX Officer\u2019s calendar exports and seven weeks\u2019 worth of the reports sought in this request, which contain much of the same exempt information detailed above, would require the same timely review and consultation. Accordingly, gathering and reviewing the requested scope of records would require dozens of staff hours to review hundreds of individual records and lines of data, and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This is not a denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow this request, you may to specify a particular matter for which you seek records, limit the scope of the records sought, and/or limit the timeframe of the search. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

Copies of reports filed via this link ( https://cps.guardianconduct.com/incident-reporting ) from May 1, 2024 to May 3, 2024. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including birth dates, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, portions of records are exempt from release pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made and copies of reports filed at the referenced link have been withheld from disclosure pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) and 7(1)(n) of the FOIA as they have been determined to be factual information inextricably intertwined\u00a0with an ongoing\u00a0investigation or disciplinary proceeding. Section 7(1)(f) states \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f)] Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" (Id. at 248, 799 N.E.2d at 864). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d Further, redactions have been applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

Calendars for Jennifer Chan, CPS Ethics Officer, from January 1, 2024 - the date this FOIA is processed. \r\nRESPONSE : The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has reviewed these portions of your request and determined that, as currently written, they are unduly burdensome beyond the public interest in seeking numerous records maintained in multiple locations and which contain highly sensitive and exempt information that would require a timely and careful review. In order to respond to this request, the CPS FOIA Office would first be required to separately gather the requested calendar exports and conduct an eDiscovery search to produce the requested email log. The FOIA Office has conducted a preliminary e-discovery search with the parameters set forth in this request, which yielded 1,241 search results. Due to the nature of the email search, in seeking two weeks\u2019 worth of the CPS Ethics Officer\u2019s email account (the individual responsible for intaking and responding to ethics inquiries, submitted via email from any CPS official, employee, vendor, parent or member of the community) without a filter by subject matter or keyword, subject line and sender and recipient lines are extremely likely to contain personal email addresses, the identity of employees, parents, vendors, or members of the public witness to or reporting Ethics matters, exempt details of communications between a public body and its attorney, and details of pending investigations, which would require a careful and timely review of not only each of the 1,241 lines of metadata pulled in the log, but the emails themselves and consultation with the Ethics Office in order to determine if any portion of the data is exempt from disclosure. Further, producing five months\u2019 of the CPS Ethics Officer\u2019s calendar exports is likely contain much of the same exempt information detailed above, and would require the same timely review and consultation. Accordingly, gathering and reviewing the requested scope of records would require dozens of staff hours and therefore, as your FOIA request is currently written, the dedication of staff and/or resources is unduly burdensome on the daily operations of the CPS beyond the public interest. This is not a denial of these portions of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), we are asking that you narrow these portions of your request, in writing, to more manageable proportions.\u00a0 If you do not modify or revise these portions of your request to more manageable proportions within five (5) business days, your request will be considered denied. If you do seek to narrow this request, you may to specify a particular ethics matter for which you seek records, limit the scope of the records sought, and/or limit the timeframe of the search. 3. Membership list of those on the CPS Ethics Committee as of the date this FOIA is processed. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to this portion of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

In particular, I am requesting a single spreadsheet (with different sheets for each month) or a series of spreadsheets for each month with the following variables (where DEPARTMENT NAME == CDCR): \r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT NAME\r\nFACILITY NAME\r\nCOUNTY NAME\r\nLAST NAME\t\r\nFIRST NAME\r\nINT INDICATOR\r\nCLASSIFICATION TITLE\r\nCLASS TYPE\r\nCEA INDICATOR\r\nTIME BASE\r\nTENURE\r\nSALARY PER\r\nBASE SALARY\r\nON-LEAVE INDICATOR\r\nUNIQUE IDENTIFIER\r\nSAFETY MEMBER\r\nOASDI\r\nCBID\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Unfortunately, the \"playtime\r\nreport\" is just the data that's available within the i-ready system;\r\nthere's no option  within the software to export that data, nor do we have\r\naggregate data by school or district, just a YTD total of playtime minutes\r\nfor each class at each school. Putting that data into a shareable format\r\nwould involve manually tabulating data for each school. As per our\r\noriginal estimates this would be many many hours of staff time.\r\n\r\nNow that I better understand the software, I also took another look at the\r\nsample you'd provided from Warwick(?) schools; I see that they have some\r\ndata access included in their contract. I will find out if our contract\r\nprovides for the same, and we will reach out again to the vendor to see if\r\nthey have the ability to provide similar data for us.

Guarino (DoB: 9/14/1967), the Sodexo operations manager assigned to MCC until February 2022.\r\n\r\n## Specific records\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following specific records:\r\n1.) Any communications with Sodexo regarding the lawsuit or Roger Guarino's status at MCC or the MCC Association.\r\n2.) Any communications between MCC, the MCC Association, or  Roger Guarino regarding the lawsuit or any steps taken by MCC or the MCC Association in response to the lawsuit.\r\n3.) Any communications with any other educational institution regarding Roger Guarino, including any communications with the University of Arkansas - Little Rock, where Sodexo reassigned Roger Guarino to another position that involved interacting with children despite being aware of the child molestation lawsuit.\r\n\r\n## Applicability of FOIL to the  MCC Association, Inc \r\n\r\nI contend that records maintained MCC Association, Inc, a non-profit associated MCC, are within the scope of the New York Freedom of Information Law. Such records constitute \"material received by a corporation providing services for a State university and kept on behalf of the university\" (Encore Coll v. Auxiliary Serv NY Court of Appeals (1995) 87 N.Y.2d 410,414) and are thus \"a record subject to disclosure under FOIL\" (id.).\r\n\r\n## Fees\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees in excess of $200, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEdward",

The purpose of this letter is to ask that you clarify or narrow your request by providing us with more information about the particular records you seek. The following paragraph highlights the aspect of your request that we find to be unclear or overly broad. \r\n \r\nRegarding the second part of your request, please clarify what you mean by \u201cthe events of April 24, 2024\u201d. Are you referring to the protests that took place on campus? \r\n\r\nRegarding part 3 of your request, initial searches indicate that the responsive information would be voluminous. The time required to process this amount of information would result in a high cost for you and would likely take months to process. As such, we wish to discuss how the scope of your request might be narrowed to target some smaller set of records. \r\nFirst, if there is some specific information that you are looking for that may have been included in emails sent or received by the listed individuals, please describe that particular information so that we can conduct a targeted search for it. The more specific you can be about what you are looking for, the more quickly we can determine whether it exists and release it to you. \r\n\r\nIf there is not some specific information that you are looking for, then we ask that you consider providing more detail regarding the subject matter of your request. There are many aspects of the recent protests that these individuals communicated about (examples include student safety, safety of the public, free speech issues, University rules related to protests, student conduct matters, the involvement of people unconnected to UT Austin, etc.). Is there some specific aspect of the protests that you are looking for communications about? You can either provide a description of the subject matter in which you are interested or provide some keywords that we can search for within his emails. \r\n\r\nRegarding parts 4 and 5 of your request, please confirm whether \u201celected official\u201d includes federal officials in addition to members of Congress. If so, please specify so that we can locate those communications. Any additional detail you can provide about which \u201celected officials\u201d you intend to be included would be appreciated. Since we do not have a comprehensive list of them, they may be difficult to identify. \r\n \r\nPlease let us know how you wish to proceed. Upon receipt of your response, we will resume work on your request.\u00a0 You may deliver your response by replying to this email or by any one of the following means: \r\n \r\nBy U.S. Mail: \r\nAttn:\u00a0 Open Records Coordinator \r\nOffice of the Vice President for Legal Affairs \r\nThe University of Texas at Austin \r\nP.O.

Since these parts of your request ask for all communications between their office and with staff members of Texas elected officials and members of Congress, they anticipate that a substantial percentage of their daily communications will be responsive, since most of their work consists of communicating with those staff, regarding a large variety of issues. In particular, since part 4 of your request isn't limited to communications that include certain keywords or are regarding particular subject matters. Would you be willing to (i) limit parts 4 and 5 of your request to seeking communications with Texas elected officials and members of Congress, excluding their staff, and/or (ii) provide some subject matter to which the communications responsive to part 4 of your request should pertain? \r\nPlease note that, in accordance with section 552.222 of the Texas Government Code, your request will be considered withdrawn if you do not respond to this request for narrowing and clarification in writing within 61 days from the date of this message. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact my office at 512-471-8300.

Once contacted, the company providing our open records management system indicated that we can run a report that displays basic information on the requests submitted, including: reference number, create date, request status, customer name, and basic description of public record desired. \nAccording to that company, there . To capture the communications information, the requests will need to be exported one at a time. is no way to run a report that shows all correspondence or communications related to the requests \nAdditionally, approximately 163 of these 1,750 requests were filled out manually, in-person at our front desk. These handwritten requests were scanned into the online system. Like the communications information, these handwritten requests will need to be exported one at a time. \nYou can reduce the estimated time and cost to complete your request by withdrawing the portion of your request that was asking for communications related to each request, thereby reducing the need to export each request one at a time. Keep in mind, even if you withdraw the communications portion of your request, the handwritten requests described above will still need to be exported one at a time. The cost estimate for that is option is listed below. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n163 requests x 1.5 min processing time = 244.5 min (4.08 hours) \nLABOR \n4.08 hours x $15/hr = $61.13 \nOVERHEAD \n$61.13 x 20% = $12.23 \nTOTAL \n$61.13 + $12.23 = $ 73.36 \nSincerely, \nLisa Foster \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Open Records Request Portal (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXf-2BjtJqt2dHoqDdFRIHkBPHGWMOA4-2BxvG16RM1bx2PEQ88xYavF7SDw7vGsjj2Aw456tooE9-2BjQu-2FIWhdjT61bAgFbv7gOEFpVTxeQ-2FKoejxwKd3_qyIcOwuygsI0WqwjM028jb5Y9LgrC-2Fel3HsXl5voGGSmUK36IQWS0Thguh8aRfv-2FhJ0PBbFQZuz9382wAHtFd161neXwDsWwGGNcVnPnV-2BV1VpnXcxn2KWpfN-2FtRT1MFT9LiTDr08lMN4jqfqp-2BcYUcF-2Bv2anI-2B75A0cieXrQXbQ8REr5O-2Bnv2c0qKbeNLTSEHaKyvRSgs4wgC80TL3heVCu3pH8ZfGg4cSqf-2ByRiJe-2FSx0eVwN0hQs2bdE9HSmlThFHt1t5tum6Kul3yj-2F6cT46dRm8-2Fo-2Flw3STV5e2k1uEs1xmnq6CVMflGpDLLZDOoLEqkRqTaKaRyKbX9xIwbsEc0jd9tl78F2GTw48tyDW49yiuot3DeDBe9l539P-2B5GTfupZYp5boEUSwbrrfBDg-3D-3D)\n",

Your request mentioned: Please provide all FOIA requests sent to McLennan County and all entities under the McLennan County umbrella and all departments in the McLennan County System from January 1st 2024 to 06/17/2024. We do not need any responsive document just the original request and any communications related to that request, we do not need the actual responsive documents. \nFurther clarification is required to complete your request: Dustin Chapman forwarded an email stating you would accept the $73.36 charge for the manual request and a bulk pull of the rest, but I need to confirm in writing that you are waving your request for \"any communications\" that go with each request since those would have to be pulled individually if you are still wanting them. Please confirm in writing that you are waving that portion of your request and I can continue. Thank you. Respond to this email with the details requested above. Upon receipt of clarification, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office will further respond to your public records request as required by law. For questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

It partially fulfills item #3 on the list, however, items #1, #2, and #4 remain unanswered/denied.  If I cannot obtain these contracts, footage, or complaints through your organization please let me know, as per NRS 239.0107(1). If this is the case, I would also appreciate direction to the correct agency. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I believe the NPRA law requires agencies to provide reasoning for the denial of public records (NRS 239.0107(d)).\r\n\r\nI recognize fulfilling the totality of my original request would result in the search for a large number of documents, so if it helps, the purpose of my request is to understand the relationship between UNR and Starship through their contracts and agreements, as well as marketing plans. I also want to understand the relationship between UNR students and Starship through incident reports and video footage.  If you find that you do have the records that I am looking for, and need more time to gather them, please provide me with a date that they will be ready by. \r\n\r\nThank you for your help, and let me know if you need me to provide more clarification. \r\n\r\nMy best,\r\nBrooke Germain",

Some of the information requested is not available in a report.  However, I have attached as much as is possible at this time.  Additionally, please find our response to your Public Information Request. Identifying factors (Names) have been redacted in accordance with \u00a74-501 of the General Provisions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The list requested by you, albeit a public record, is also a \"personal record\" pursuant to Section 4-501 of the General Provisions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland because it names the employee. While the PIA makes it clear that the salary of a public employee is subject to disclosure, Section 4-401 of the General Provisions Article makes it unlawful for an employee of a governmental unit to willfully and knowingly allow inspection or use of a public record that names or, with reasonable certainty, otherwise identifies the individual by an identifying factor. Amongst other things, Section 4-501(c)(3)(iv) & (v) of the General Provisions Article states that the Custodian must disclose to persons of interest/employees: 1) whether the personal information is generally available for public inspection and 2) whether the personal information collected is made available, transferred or shared with any other entity other than the Custodian.   \r\n \r\nIt could also be argued that this is a part of the employee's personnel record. [But for the exemption of the salary of a public employee], Section 4-311 prohibits inspection of an employee's personnel record except by the employee, an elected or appointed official who supervises the employee's work or an employee organization described in Title 6 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, none of which are applicable in this case.\r\n \r\nIt is our practice to disclose job titles and salaries only per the above listed provisions of the Annotated Code of Maryland.",
