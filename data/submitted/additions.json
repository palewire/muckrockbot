This request is related to the incident involving a school bus where the suspect allegedly blocked the vehicle, resisted officers, and was tased:\r\n\r\n3/30/2023, around 3:45 pm, officers were sent to W. Matlock and N. 8th Street for a vehicle blocking the pathway of an APISD school bus. While officers were on their way, the information updated to state a female pedestrian was standing in front of the school bus preventing it from continuing its route. The bus was occupied by several students under the age of 17 and two adult employees of the ISD.  \r\n\r\nEVENT #23-7398, UNLAWFUL RESTRAINT \u2013 SCHOOL BUS\r\n\r\nBody-worn camera footage from all responding officers involved in the arrest.\r\nIncident reports and arrest reports regarding this case.\r\nDashcam footage from any patrol units that responded to the scene.\r\nRear-seat police vehicle footage (if applicable) from the unit that transported the suspect following her arrest.\r\nThis request seeks essential records documenting the suspect\u2019s alleged unlawful restraint of the bus, resistance to arrest, and harassment of an officer (spitting on police). If any 911 calls or additional footage (such as school bus surveillance) exist, I request them only if they provide additional relevant details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a waiver of all fees as the release of these records serves the public interest by contributing to transparency in law enforcement actions and public safety matters, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or through a secure online portal if available. If any associated costs apply, please notify me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific legal exemption under Texas law that justifies the denial.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If any 911 calls exist, I request them only if they provide additional relevant details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver as the disclosure of these records serves the public interest in ensuring transparency in law enforcement actions and documenting public safety incidents, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or a secure online portal if available. If any costs apply, please notify me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Florida law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",
