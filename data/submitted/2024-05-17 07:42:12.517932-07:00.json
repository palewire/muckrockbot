The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed contemporaneous exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

        "communication": "I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against the actions of individuals involved in the watchlist operation, which I believe have resulted in the commission of unlawful acts. It has come to my attention that certain individuals associated with the watchlist operation are engaging in tactics such as man-in-the-middle cyber attacks to obstruct, manipulate, and misrepresent communications, particularly when submitting online reports to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, Attorneys, and other Government entities. For the sake of transparency and accountability, I am submitting this complaint through Muck Rock to ensure that the public is informed of my concerns and to facilitate the proper filing and tracking of this complaint.\r\n\r\nMy involvement in this matter stems from being unjustly placed on a watchlist subsequent to my disclosure of misconduct within the Radiology Department at Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur, Missouri. I strongly believe that I obtain proof and may have witnesses that substantiates my claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to you with regard to my 6 year wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), Air National Guard, Army, and Contractors.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have been subjected to unfair treatment that includes one or more persons acting under color of law willfully depriving and conspiring to deprive me of my rights protected by the constitution.  This misconduct goes beyond mere allegations of negligence commonly associated with law enforcement collaborations with Fusion Centers.\r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates. Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n\r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI urge the United States Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me. \r\n\r\nYour expertise and oversight in this matter are crucial to ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of our national security systems. Your prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your dedicated service and commitment to upholding the highest standards of accountability and security in our government operations.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins\r\nGranite City, Illinois 62040-2013",

        "communication": "I am writing to you with regard to my wrongful inclusion in a watchlist under the jurisdiction of the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC). I have reason to believe that I have been subjected to various forms of abuse, harassment, and exploitation as a result of this inclusion. This grievance pertains specifically to the actions of individuals within the Saint Louis Fusion Center, as well as its collaborative partners in State, Local, Tribal, Territorial Law Enforcement (F/SLTT), National Guard, Army, and Contractors. \r\n  \r\nIt has come to my attention that the Saint Louis Fusion Center, in conjunction with programs established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as the St. Louis Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), has engaged in practices that have violated established security protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and federal laws, notably the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.  \r\n  \r\nI have reason to believe that certain individuals associated with the operation have inappropriately disseminated my personal information for fraudulent purposes, potentially for personal gain, thereby compromising my privacy and potentially exposing me to unwarranted harm. These actions have not only caused me distress but have also raised serious concerns regarding the integrity and legality of the operations carried out by the Saint Louis Fusion Center and its affiliates.  Moreover, I am deeply troubled by the revelation that there are instances of misuse of telecommunications satellites and systems, which may pose a threat to security and integrity. I have reason to believe that these individuals have been using intelligence tactics to instill fear and create a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this operation, I have experienced instances of cruel and unusual punishment, including sexual misconduct, harassment, bodily injuries, discrimination, exploitation, mail tampering, and medical violations due to the arbitrary exercise of power. Furthermore, I have encountered Intelligence operators who have been involved in concealing, altering, and destroying evidence relevant to the situation. Additionally, these operators have intercepted telephone lines in an attempt to hinder me from reporting the illicit activities to government authorities and attorneys.\r\n  \r\nAs a law-abiding citizen, I expect that my rights and privacy are protected by those tasked with upholding the law. It is disheartening to discover that I have become a victim of misconduct and negligence within a system that is meant to safeguard the well-being of its citizens.  \r\n  \r\nI urge the Saint Louis Fusion Center to conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take the necessary steps to rectify any injustices that have been inflicted upon me. Furthermore, I request that appropriate measures be implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct within the organization.  \r\n  This letter serves as notice to the Saint Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group (STLFC) to immediately cease and desist the following activities:\r\n1.)\tMisuse of collected data for personal gain.\r\n2.)\tMisuse of telecommunication and intelligence systems in order to harass, exploit, and deprive me of my constitutional rights. This includes ALL civil rights and liberties.\r\n3.)\tAny/All violations of the Standard Operating Systems (SOP).\r\n4.)\tAny/All fraud in relation to computers outlined specifically in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC SEC 1030.\r\n5.)   Any/All unauthorized spying or monitoring that infringes on privacy rights.\r\n6.)   Impede and/or misrepresent communication or reporting with government entities and law firms.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Saint Louis Fusion Center will address this matter with the seriousness and urgency it deserves and provide me with a prompt response regarding the steps that will be taken to address my grievances.  \r\n  \r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexandra Collins",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. Please provide each deliverable 1-5, or itemize and concatenate as per the request order for pricing and delivery.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. Please provide this metadata and note that no per-page fee should be levied.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
