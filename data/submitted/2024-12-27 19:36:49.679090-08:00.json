All application materials submitted by Immigration Judge Abby Meyer in connection with her appointment as a U.S. immigration judge, including cover letters, resumes, and any documents addressing quality ranking factors.\r\n\r\n2. A redacted copy of all remands for Immigration Judge Abby Meyer ordered by the Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n\r\n3. Copies of all judicial complaints filed with Office of IJ Conduct and Professionalism of the Executive Office for Immigration Review concerning Immigration Judge Abby Meyer.\r\n\r\nPlease search all locations and systems likely to have responsive records, regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.\r\nOur request for records includes any attachments to those records or other materials enclosed with those records when they were previously transmitted. To the extent that an email is responsive to our request, our request includes all prior messages sent or received in that email chain, as well as any attachments to the email. \r\n\r\nPlease search all relevant records or systems containing records regarding agency business. Do not exclude records regarding agency business contained in files, email accounts, or devices in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts or text messages. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files are subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.\r\n\r\n It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I retain my right to records contained in those files even if the material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, by intent or through negligence, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nPlease use all tools available to your agency to conduct a complete and efficient search for potentially responsive records. Agencies are subject to governmentwide requirements to manage agency information electronically,1and many agencies have adopted the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies. These systems provide options for searching emails and other electronic records in a manner that is reasonably likely to be more complete than just searching individual custodian files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but your agency\u2019s archiving tools may capture that email under Capstone. At the same time, custodian searches are still necessary; agencies may not have direct access to files stored in .PST files, outside of network drives, in paper format, or in personal email accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically why it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHassan Ahmad",

These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
