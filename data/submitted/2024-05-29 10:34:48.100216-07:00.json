        "communication": "Town of Jupiter,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI would like to request the phone records for Officer Diana Zeitz between the dates of 01/06/24 and 01/16/24, No filters are needed, raw data is fine. This is now the second request to the town, please reference the attached police records request invoice (Paid on Receipt).\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phone service from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, it is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or an unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone and/or the carrier. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (i.e. call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any fees associated pertaining to this request, I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment and/or download link as per Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Jaspal Singh, age 57, who died on April 15, 2024, at the GEO-owned Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between April 15, 2024, and May 28, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Jaspal Singh died in ICE custody on April 15, 2024. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/indian-national-ice-custody-dies-hospital\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Charles Leo Daniel who died March 7, 2024, and before that, in the cases Frankline Okpu and Salvador Vargas, to name just a few.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Singh is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. ICE has engaged a pattern and practice of violating its own policy and Congressional appropriations requirements by failing to post death reports within the 30-day period following detainee deaths.\r\n7. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Folkston facility.\r\n8. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Singh's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Singh's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Folkston facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to a cartoonist and web designer named Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Richards (born October 20th, 1946 - died April 21st, 2023) was a cartoonist in the 1960s and 70s. His work was frequently featured in publications such as The Berkeley Tribe. His death was widely reported, and a news report regarding his passing should be attached, and can be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2023/04/24/ted-richards-rip/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the Cartoonist Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a thorough search for any records on Richards held by the Cincinnati, San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Please note, there appears to have been a previous FOIA request with the bureau for records related to The Berkeley Tribe (FOIA: 1394913-0). Much of that file, which is currently accessible on the Internet Archive, appears to be heavily redacted. Please re-examine The Berkeley Tribe release in relation to the release of documents related to Theodore Richards. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the work that the bureau does, and for the bureau's commitment to transparency. I look forward to the resolution of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
