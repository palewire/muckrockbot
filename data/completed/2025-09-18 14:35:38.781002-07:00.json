The City of Novato received your California Public Records Act request, dated August 10, 2025, which requested the following: All email communications between City Council Members Mark Milberg, Rachael Farac, Tim O'Conner, Kevin Jacobs, and Pat Eklund and Brian Skinner between January 1 2025 and August 11 2025. \r\n\r\nAll email communications between City Council Members Mark Milberg, Rachael Farac, Tim O'Conner, Kevin Jacobs, and Pat Eklund that includes the words \"Skate Park\" \"Homeless\" and \"tent\" \"unhoused\" \r\nUnder Government Code section 7922.535, subdivision (a), this message shall serve as a formal response to your request. This message shall also serve as notification that I am the person responsible for determining which records are responsive and subject to production under Government Code section 7922.540. \r\n\r\nThe City has completed a reasonable search of its records and determined there are responsive documents as well as certain records and/or portions thereof which have been determined to be exempt from disclosure and have therefore been redacted or will not be disclosed pursuant to the statutory exemptions noted below: \r\n\r\n \r\n  *  Attorney-Client Privilege \u2013 Government Code sections 7927.705 and 7930.110; Evidence Code sections 952 and 954; Bus. & Prof. Code section 6068 \u2013 Records which are exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including those relating to attorney-client privilege, are exempt from disclosure.  \r\n \r\n  *  Attorney Work Product \u2013 Government Code sections 7927.705 and 7930.110; Code of Civ. Proc. section 2018.030 \u2013 Writings that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories are exempt from disclosure.  \r\n \r\n  *  Deliberative Process Privilege \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing the deliberations of agency officials used to reach a decision because of the potential chilling effect disclosure would have on candid, informed policymaking.  \r\n \r\n  *  Preliminary Drafts and Similar Materials \u2013 Government Code section 7927.500 \u2013 Any preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business are exempt from disclosure where the public interest in non-disclosure is clearly outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records revealing incomplete planning and deliberation between inter and intra agency officials used to reach a decision because of the potential chilling effect disclosure would have on candid, informed policymaking and regional collaboration on sensitive issues.  \r\n \r\n  *  Personally Identifying Information \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Superior Court (2017) 221 Cal.Rptr.3d 832 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of information that infringes upon privacy rights, such as personal cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses.  \r\n \r\n  *  Confidential Informants and Investigatory or Security Files\u00a0 \u2013 Government Code sections 7923.600, 7922.000; Evidence Code sections 1040, 1041 \u2013 Any complaints to a local police agency or any investigatory or security files compiled by a local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes are exempt from disclosure. The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the identity of a person who has furnished information in confidence to the City for administration or enforcement of a law alleged to be violated.  \r\n Public Interest Balancing Test \u2013 Government Code section 7922.000 \u2013 The public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of records that would reveal inter and intra agency deliberative processes and drafts, personal contact information, the identities of individual complainants, or would otherwise impede the City\u2019s ability to coordinate public responses or policy decisions. The responsive records are available using the following link: \r\nCity Records Request - N000429-081025 (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXbzH6-2Fd5sE2jVnwq9X8NPpyh-2Fqcjpx2s7sp8fUo2KPo3tDnu-2BQ9OUcE-2FwEJM0j3rY7cCgqbpWkt-2B4tn0VcFC2fE-3DiVOY_9CbA04xfgwfwb2ZTHMNJme4rDMzosohjD-2BMKdPzseaxT0onxwfoKrHzEDPUdg8tbiU9Gggebz95AZk7nQ6v8OM9jWBfHk4TJveJn09-2BoTvMymKZPYSA9c99NaEBBFrTfdhVxC4H6Tb-2BEBF7SLLQJ-2FlQuGLl9otu56f-2FTwUS0S7suHZib7ehNGliUgQYEP89noipYw7zsJ-2BBdrWSUs9frh-2B5QiUoI3oAI61zBXfMSPULnay4mBR2aFFwKUUgE7wZxMqHKKaE-2BMOHIBkWu5dPhr9F4Vn0QLg52oXaOYxGN48gg8u7vXC2fBoBftKtJO5cXpESCU8RRJtzMt56j7eXiqzLJhgBmqAqcAAy9SoJyeB-2BO9nje5HkeY303Z4p-2FVBSW) Please be advised the City will not allow inspection or copying of any privileged documents. While we will try to remove all privileged documents, the inadvertent inclusion of any privileged documents does not constitute a waiver and we ask you to notify us of any privileged material that is inadvertently provided. Also be advised the City is not required to produce documents that are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act, records destroyed in accordance with Government Code section 34090 and the City\u2019s records retention policy, or records that include such information that the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by the disclosure of the records. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to discuss your request further or if I can assist you in clarifying the request, identifying records responsive to the request, or requesting additional records. \r\n\r\nKindest regards, \r\n\r\nLaura McDowall \r\nCity Clerk",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items 1-4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nWe also note that your agency has provided these records to us in the past. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. However, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n Dave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any communications between Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin and Georgetown University, Georgetown University Law Center, or William M.\u00a0Treanor\u00a0 between February 1, 2025 and May 8, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely a United States Attorney's initiation of an \"inquiry\" into the academic content of courses at a private law school.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nb. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nc. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\nd. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\ne. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\nf. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\ng. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\nh. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\ni. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nj. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nk. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nl. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nm. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\nn. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\no. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\np. https://www.foxnews.com/media/georgetown-professors-slam-trumps-dei-crackdown-attack-religious-freedom-jesuit-schools\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum. This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on a law school to limit viewpoints offered in classroom teaching protected by the First Amendment. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry.\" Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The district is well past its statutory timeline.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is intended to formally request that the district:\r\n- Acknowledge receipt of my FOIL request immediately.\r\n- Provide an estimated timeline for its fulfillment, including anticipated delivery of responsive documents.\r\n- If applicable, identify any non-responsive items and explain the basis for any redactions, exemptions, or fees.\r\n\r\nPlease note that NYS Archives LGS-1 requires permanent retention of strategic plans and a six-year minimum retention for supporting drafts, notes, and contracting records. Federal regulations (2 CFR \u00a7 200.334; 34 CFR \u00a7 100.6(c)) also require retention of records tied to federal funds and equity compliance for no less than three years.\r\n\r\nFor transparency and consistency, I am copying this appeal to the New York State Committee on Open Government (COOG), which has issued public guidance reinforcing the five-day acknowledgment requirement and the timely provision of responsive records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nCC: NYS Committee on Open Government (COOG)",

In your response, you stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll requests for information should be directed to our records management officer, Matt Leon. I have copied him on this email so that he may begin to process your request.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat reply reflects a misunderstanding. As this communication is a statutory appeal under Public Officers Law \u00a789(4)(a)\u2014not an initial request\u2014it is your obligation, as the designated appeals officer, to review and determine the appeal within ten business days, not refer it back to the records access officer.\r\n\r\nCOOG\u2019s guidance is explicit:\r\n\r\n- The FOIL Appeals Officer cannot also serve as the Records Access Officer (see: https://opengovernment.ny.gov/foil-training-materials).\r\n- That officer \u201cmust either provide records sought or \u2018fully explain\u2019 reasons for further denial (or both) within 10 business days\u201d (ibid).\r\n- The statute requires that the appeal, and the written determination, be transmitted to COOG immediately upon receipt and upon issuance of the determination (ibid).\r\n\r\nYour misdirection\u2014sending the appeal back to the records access officer\u2014is contrary to both the statute and COOG\u2019s formal advice. At this point, the absence of a determination constitutes a constructive denial of the appeal. \r\n\r\nI also note a concerning pattern of procedural non-compliance by the district in handling FOIL requests and appeals, reflected in repeated delays and misapplications of the process.\r\n\r\nGiven that COOG is copied here, I respectfully recommend COOG consider mandating FOIL training and compliance measures for Niskayuna CSD, including clarification of the separation between the Records Access Officer and the Appeals Officer, and reinforcing timeliness obligations.\r\n\r\nI again formally request, without further delay:\r\n\r\n1. A proper written determination on my appeal, in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a);\r\n2. Confirmation that both the appeal and your determination have been transmitted to COOG as required.\r\n\r\ncc: Committee on Open Government",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records.  Please note that the data provided is raw data and may contain errors and/or omissions. Please also be advised that the District does not comprehensively track the date a student enrolled as a result of a school assignment request . Thus, this portion of your request is asking the District to create a new record to answer your question. The Freedom of Information Act requires a public body to provide existing public records, subject to certain exceptions. The request must reasonably describe the requested records. A reasonable description requires the record to be reasonably identified as a record not as a general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the [public body] does not generally create. (See Krohn v. Department of Justice, 628 F.2d 195 (1980)). Second,\u00a0 FOIA obligations apply to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32,\u00a0 \u00a0 540 N.E.2d 11, 13 (1989) (quoting Krohn v. Department of Justice, 628 F.2d 195, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). This request requires CPS to not merely pull data out of a database and provide it to you, but instead asks CPS to compile data from multiple sources into a single record, manipulate it to answer your questions, and this combination of data does not already exist in any CPS database. (See generally Hites v. Waubonsee Comm. College, Il App 2d, 150836 (2016)(... \"requests went beyond a search for records\u2014that is, the data in the databases\u2014and instead improperly sought information about those records.\" quoting National Security Counselors v. Central Intelligence Agency, 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 271 (D.D.C. 2012) and Chicago Tribune v. DFPR, IL App. (4th) 130437 at 8 (2014) (\"[t]he Department was not obligated ... to answer plaintiff's \"general inquiry question\" concerning the number of initial claims since this would have required creating a new record.\")  \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

A uniformed security patrol officer in a Citiguard vehicle approached them. The security officer asks them to stop recording and leave property, and then appears to initiate a vehicle pursuit in a Citiguard marked patrol vehicle on public roads that reach reported speeds of 70mph to 100mph. According to BSIS's website, Citiguard's owner is GHARZAI NOMAIR, and Citiguard has two  previous citations for employing non-licensed security officers. \r\n\r\nAs such, I am requesting the following:\r\n1) Citiguard's License, Certificates, or other verification documents that indicate their authority to work in California City, CA\r\n2) Citiguard's current Private Patrol Operator application and/or most recent renewal application, packet, or documentation submitted to achieve BSIS licensure for license 121572, and for any branch or other licenses that permit Citiguard's operations within California City, CA. \r\n3) Any complaints, investigations, notices, or tips related to Citiguard from January 2024 through the date of completion of this request \r\n4) Any emails that your office has received or sent relating to the September 2nd, 2025 incident involving Citiguard at the CoreCivic Detention Center\r\n5) Any Citiguard policies relating to foot or vehicle pursuits, use of force continuum, verbal de-escalation, or patrol SOPs that are in your possession\r\n\r\nThis is a newsworthy event, I respectfully request that you expedite this request to the extent possible. You may send documents as they become available. I appreciate you taking the time to fulfil this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

        "communication": "03/17/2025 \r\n\r\nAndrew  Free \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR182986 \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25063 \r\n \r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025, your request for a waiver of all assessable FOIA fees, and your request for expedited treatment. Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested all records pertaining to IHSC Mortality Review for Brendy Yohana Bamaca-Zacarais, who died in ICE Custody September 7, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrBrendyYohanaBamacaZacarias.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25063. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request # 1433170-000 for FBI records concerning 065-HQ-57411. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

The reference number for tracking purposes is P005355-060825\u00a0. Records Requested:\u00a0To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7.

We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.

That prior release confirms that such presentation materials are regularly prepared, used, and subject to disclosure under the Public Records Law. \r\n\r\nBy way of example, additional Community CompStat presentations were held in District D-4 (South End) on Aug 27th, and in other districts citywide during this August and September 2025 time period. Feel free to exclude the Aug 26 E-13 presentation that has already been provided if it makes it easier for you. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the complete presentation materials (e.g., PowerPoint, slide deck, PDF, or other format) as displayed at each meeting. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage. \r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please note, due to a software error, the \"fee charged\" has defaulted to zero for each request. There were certain requests from 2024 where the MBTA did charge a fee. If you have questions about any particular request, please let us know. \r\n\r\nIn addition, certain information has been redacted form this record, including dates of birth, license numbers, personal medical information, and the names of any injured parties. This information is exempt from disclosure under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 4, Section 7(26) (c), which exempts materials or data \u201crelating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d. The MBTA has determined that the public interest in the release of this personal information does not outweigh the privacy interests of the individual(s) involved. To the extent that this information falls under the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d under M.G.L. c. 93H and 201 CMR 17.00, it must be  redacted. In addition, the disclosure of personal data is prohibited by the federal Fair Information Practices Act and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 66, Section 2(c) which states, in part, that every holder maintaining personal data shall \"not allow any other agency or individual not employed by the holder to have access to personal data unless such access is authorized by statute or regulations which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter...\" \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in the case of a denial of access to records, you have the right to an administrative appeal to the Supervisor of Records, pursuant to 950 CMR 32.08(1) (the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), and the right to seek judicial review by commencing an action in the Superior Court. \r\n\r\nWe will provide the 2025 requests running to the date of your public records request soon. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulie Ciollo \r\nAssistant General Counsel/ \r\nRecords Access Officer",

Please note that while\r\nresponsive records have been located, certain information is required by\r\nlaw to be withheld. Specifically, the Connecticut Freedom of Information\r\nAct and federal student privacy laws (including FERPA) mandate the\r\nprotection of personally identifiable information related to students, as\r\nwell as certain personal data related to staff. For this reason, redactions\r\nwere applied prior to release.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the format in which the submissions are stored does not lend\r\nitself to clean printing. The records have nonetheless been preserved in\r\ntheir original form, with only the necessary redactions made to protect\r\nstudents and staff.\r\n\r\nWe trust this clarifies the basis for the formatting and redaction in the\r\nmaterials provided.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFrancine Coss\r\n\r\n\r\n*Francine Coss*\r\nSuperintendent of Schools\r\n\r\n*Thomaston Public Schools Mission Statement:*\r\n\r\nIn a partnership of family, school and community, our mission is to\r\n*educate*, *challenge* and *inspire* each individual to excel and become a\r\ncontributing member of society.\r\n*Thomaston Public Schools*\r\n185 Branch Road\r\nThomaston, CT 06787\r\nPhone: 860-283-3053\r\nFax: 860-283-3096\r\nwww.thomastonschools.org\r\n@ThomastonBOE <https://twitter.com/ThomastonBOE>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*The information contained in this communication may be confidential or\r\nlegally privileged and is intended only for the recipient(s) named above.\r\nIf the reader of this message is not the intended recipient, you are hereby\r\nnotified that any dissemination, distribution or copying of this\r\ncommunication or its contents is strictly prohibited.

        "communication": "The Office of the General Counsel received your above referenced California Public Records Act (PRA) Request, which seeks the records listed below.  After conducting a diligent inquiry and making a thorough search of our records, the District responds as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.  All finalized Comprehensive School Safety Plans submitted from 2018 to present in a word or .pdf file.\r\n                        Please note this Request demands the Los Angeles Unified School District, which has 1,543 schools, provide over 10,000 reports.  Consequently, the records requested have been determined to be exempt pursuant to the following authority:\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     \"A clearly framed request which requires an agency to search an enormous volume of data . . . . or, conversely, a request which compels the production of a huge volume of material may be objectionable as unduly burdensome.\" California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App.4th 159, 166; citing American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 186. \"[C]ourts should not ignore any expense and inconvenience involved in segregating [information].\" California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 1326.  A public agency is not to be subjected to an \"onerous burden\" when disclosing public records. ACLU v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 454.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     Records sought would be exempt pursuant to Government Code \u00a77927.000, which states: \"An agency shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of this division, or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.\"  \"The CPRA provides for more than two dozen specific exemptions, including a \"catchall\" exemption (\u00a7 6255) (now 7922.000). . . . Thus, the Act is clear that the Legislature intended to restrict the public's access to some material.\"  Regents of University of California v. Superior Court (2013) 222 Cal. App. 4th 383, 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7                     Pursuant to California Government Code section 7922.540(b), Christopher Harris, J.D., Senior Paralegal, Office of the General Counsel, Public Records Act Unit, is the person responsible for the redactions or determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I would also like a compiled excel sheet of all the Comprehensive School Safety Plans on Section 32282 reporting, specifically Section (M)(i) regarding \"Procedures to respond to incidents involving an individual experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest or a similar life-threatening medical emergency while on school grounds.\"\r\nThe District previously responded to this Request in the First Rolling Production.\r\n\r\nWith the production of the above response, the District has completed this matter.\r\nThank you for contacting the Los Angeles Unified School District Public Records Act Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A blue and red logo  Description automatically generated with low confidence]\r\nChristopher Harris, J.D., Senior Paralegal\r\nLos Angeles Unified School District, Office of General Counsel\r\n333 S.
