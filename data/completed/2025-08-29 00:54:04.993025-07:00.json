        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nThis letter concerns the request for information which this office received regarding Brian Johnson\u2019s booking sheets and booking photo. For case records, contact Austin Police Department. For the other responsive TCSO records, please refer to the email sent to you from our Travis County Attorney\u2019s Office. After examining the requested information we have determined that you may inspect and/or duplicate much of this information, as provided under the Texas Public Information Act. Accordingly please find attached responsive information for your review with the exception of the information outlined below:\r\n\r\n1. We have redacted driver's license/motor vehicle information protected under Section 552.130 of the Government Code. The law enforcement records you have requested contain information that relates to:\r\n\r\n(a) a motor vehicle operator\u2019s or driver\u2019s license or permit issued by an agency of this state or another state or country; or\r\n\r\n(b) a motor vehicle title or registration issued by an agency of this state or another state or country;\r\n\r\n(c) or a personal identification document issued by an agency of this state or another state or country or a local agency authorized to issue an identification document.\r\n\r\nThis information is confidential under sections 552.130, 552.137 and 552.101 of the Texas Government Code. Our office is prohibited by law from releasing this information to you, and therefore we have removed this information from the enclosed information we are providing to you. Normally, we must request a ruling from the Texas Attorney General before we can withhold any of the information you requested. However, section 552.130 and 552.137 allows us to withhold this specific information without requesting a ruling from the attorney general.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal our decision to withhold this information from you. Instructions for appeal are at the end of this letter. If you do not want to appeal, you do not need to do anything else. Please note that we are only withholding the specific categories of information that are confidential under section 552.130, 552.137 and 552.101. We will process the rest of your request for information in accordance with the terms of the Public Information Act.\r\n\r\n2. With regard to the date of birth information contained in TCSO's records, the Office of the Attorney General OR2019-05541 (see attached). The ruling creates a previous determination allowing TCSO to withhold a public citizen\u2019s date of birth pursuant to section 552.101 of the Government Code in conjunction with common-law privacy without seeking and Attorney General ruling. Therefore, this information is redacted.\r\n\r\nHow to appeal the withholding of information under Gov\u2019t Code section 552.130 and 552.137\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal the withholding of information discussed on the previous page, you must send the following to the attorney general:\r\n\r\n1) a signed, written statement indicating your wish to appeal the withholding of information;\r\n\r\n2) the name of the governmental body that withheld information from you;\r\n\r\n3) the date you made your original request for information; and\r\n\r\n4) a copy of your original request for information, or if you are unable to provide a copy, a description of your original request for information.\r\n\r\nYou may also submit written comments stating why you think the information should be released to you, but you are not required to do so.\r\n\r\nSend your appeal by mail to the attorney general at:\r\n\r\nOpen Records Division\r\nP.O. Box 12548\r\nAustin, Texas 78711-2548\r\n\r\nWithin forty-five business days after receiving all of the above-listed items necessary to file your appeal, the attorney general will issue a written ruling on the matter. You will receive a copy of this ruling in the mail.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions in this regard, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nTravis County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2013 Paralegal Operations\r\nPO Box 1748, Austin, Texas 78767\r\nOffice: 512-854-9718\r\nE-Mail: tcsor@traviscountytx.gov<mailto:tcsor@traviscountytx.gov>\r\nWebsite: www.tcsheriff.org<http://www.tcsheriff.org/>\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nThis electronic mail message, including any attachments, may be confidential or privileged under applicable law.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his obituary at the following link: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/vernor-vinge-father-of-the-tech-singularity-has-died-at-age-79/\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

RESPONSE : In the spirit of cooperation, documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center. Please visit the link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . This data was pulled as of point in time, June 9, 2025. Be advised that providing the data you seek \u201cbased on annual membership file as of June 9, 2025\u201d would require the district to create records that are not maintained in the regular course of business. Data analysts would be required to pull each portion of your request; datasets would have to be joined, and the data would have to be verified in order to create the record you seek. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions or prepare researched records in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. \r\nThank you for your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nThis appeal concerns FOIA request 1661626-000, which I made to the FBI, requesting documents pertaining to FBI support for the production of the TV series \"Stolen: Catching the Art Thieves.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of the Lion Television Limited representative who signed the production assistance agreement you released is redacted. To justify the redactions as a whole, the response letter cites statues b(6), b(7)(C), and b(7)(E) under FOIPA, Title 5, United States Code Section 552/552a. I am appealing the invocations of b(7)(C), and b(7)(E), which I believe are inappropriate with regard to many of these redactions.\r\n\r\nStatutes b(6) and (7)(C) is meant to protect personal privacy. This document pertains to FBI assistance with a TV production. The third-party individual whose name is redacted was not acting as a private individuals but as members of a production team. Thus, the third-party individual whose signature is redacted, I argue, could not have reasonably expected these communications to be private, nor for the FBI to hide their names. Furthermore, the disclosure of this information would be in the public interest, as it would shed additional light on the close relationship between Washington D.C.--and the FBI in particular--and the entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nStatute b(7)(E) is meant to keep law enforcement techniques and procedures private in the event that disclosure could lead to circumvention of the law. This does not apply here at all.\r\n\r\nI therefore request a further review of this redaction and a new release of the same document without the redaction of the third-party name of the signatory.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nBrett Carollo",

All slides and materials presented or given to the BOV Members for or at the October 24, 2022 BOV Executive Committee meeting. The Minutes reflected these covered a number of topics, including \"Inclusive Excellence training, admissions efforts, and the marketing and branding of VMI.\" The admissions and Inclusive Excellence were termed extensive \"deep dive\" presentations. \r\n\r\n2. Additionally, an audio recording appears to have been given to The Washington Post. If a transcript of the recording was made, I request a copy of that transcript, as well as the audio recording.\r\n\r\n3. The minutes and other information five-year Strategic Enrollment Plan with performance metrics and so I would like a copy of that.\r\n\r\n4. There was also an October 26, 2022 \"Update\" from BOV President Mr. Tom Watjen that I can no longer locate and may have been taken down.\r\n\r\n5. There sis also mention of a \"letter to alumni about one of the speakers mentioned in the BOV Meeting named \"Kimberly Dark\" and there seems to be some controversy. In references to the letter Maj. Gen. Wins mentioned something about \"there has been a group of unhappy alumni who want to stoke the worst fears and sow seeds of discord about the training and education of students here.\u201d but as with the others I can no longer find that letter on the VMI website so it may have change location. I would like the link so I have everything discussed at that meeting. There was also a mention that the presentation was videotaped and posted somewhere?\r\n\r\nAlthough there are references to these in various areas, the VMI BOV Website now no longer provides the records from the 2022 BOV Meetings (on the Main site or dashboard), so I could not access them there.\r\n\r\nThese should all be readily available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

If so, the cost is only $3.16 more. If the automatic waiver level is $50, then this is only $8.19 above that. If this is incorrect, please provide me with VMI's officially published fee waiver in these areas.\r\n\r\nVMI posts BOV Records to its website for free download.  The situation is just that it is not posting the year of this (and my other) request. While it is reasonable that some search would be required for older records before the BOV transitioned to electronic records, it is also reasonable that these should be readily available in electronic form and should be provided at no cost.\r\n\r\nBy \u00a7 2.2-3707. Meetings to be public; notice of meetings; recordings; minutes G.: \"At least one copy of the proposed agenda and all agenda packets and, unless exempt, all materials furnished to members of a public body for a meeting shall be made available for public inspection at the same time such documents are furnished to the members of the public body.\" While VMI appears to be complaint with this through its \"dashboard\" on the BOV website for recent meetings, this is not available for the 2021 and 2022 meeting . The statute does not contain any requirement that these materials must be requested at the time of the meeting, only that they should be available to the public as of \"at the same time such documents are furnished to members of the public body.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, if you decline my appeal of the fee charged, I kindly request that you complete the request form while I arrange payment. VMIU's published FOIA guidelines state: \"If we estimate that it will cost more than $200 to respond to your request, we may require a deposit, not to exceed the estimated amount, before proceeding with your request.  The five days we have to respond to your request do not include the time between when we request a deposit and when you respond.\" This is well below $200, and filling it should not be held waiting for payment.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in reviewing this and I look forward to your response.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.

        "communication": "Dear Omar Solis: \r\nThank you for your interest in public records of the San Jose Police Department. Your request was received on 6/8/2025 and is being processed. The reference number for tracking purposes is P005355-060825\u00a0. Records Requested:\u00a0To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the decision to deny waiver of fees for FOIA request # 661491-000\r\n\r\nAccording to your determination, my request did not meet the standard for waiver of fees because it would be unlikely to contribute significantly to the public's understanding of government activities and operations.\r\n\r\nAs I explain in my original FOIA request, I am the Director of Research Operations at a non-profit organization that makes these records available to the public. These and other records thus made available will, we hope and expect, be referenced in research papers and other writings, and the mere availability of them makes the public aware of an entire field of government operations (namely, collaboration with Hollywood) of which the public is largely not aware. This increased awareness, in turn, has the potential to transform the way the public sees films. Furthermore, I am the editor-in-chief of a research magazine published by said foundation  called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" to which I also contribute articles (including a recent article on NASA's relationship to Hollywood). The magazine explores, among other topics, Hollywood's relationship to the federal government, and such documents indeed are cited in the magazine.\r\n\r\nI therefore repeat my request for a waiver of fees, having rebutted the finding that this work does not contribute in any significant way to the public's understanding of government. \r\n\r\nIn the event that this waiver request is not accepted, I still wish you to process the FOIA request, under the stipulations stated in the original request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Data on individuals currently on parole from NDCS is available on our website (corrections.nebraska.gov) through the Incarceration Records database.   A link to this database is located on homepage in the right-hand menu.  If you select \"Download All\" on the searchable database, a pop-up window will appear that will give you the opportunity to download spreadsheets of information from the database.  A direct link to that pop-up is https://dcs-inmatesearch.ne.gov/Corrections/COR_download.htm.  Selecting \"Download Active\" from this pop-up window will generate spreadsheets of data on individuals with active NDCS files.  This data can be filtered by institutional release type to only include individuals released onto parole.  The NDCS database does not maintain data on whether or not an individual is on the sex offender registry.  You may wish to obtain this data from another source and compare it to active NDCS parolees.  Probation for the State of Nebraska is under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska Supreme Court.  NDCS therefore does not maintain data on current probationers.  You may wish to reach out to the Nebraska Supreme Court to request such data.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKathleen Kokensparger\r\nPublic Records Manager | CENTRAL OFFICE\r\n\r\nNebraska Department of Correctional Services\r\nOFFICE   402-479-5767\r\nFAX       402-479-5623\r\nkathleen.kokensparger@nebraska.gov<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=V4pR88jIRUVzu0a_BEeYhUyMGoCTp3IRG0H1EFpsaE6smBMvij7WCA..&URL=mailto%3akathleen.kokensparger%40nebraska.gov>\r\ncorrections.nebraska.gov<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=3tXpjzPHdUgAAM5iZyaZ3A-T_EDw-34iGlngmLlnenGsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.corrections.nebraska.gov%2f> |Facebook<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=hn51PO6-_gxC6CQ3djTJOQtClorILZHLDNrGqpqA6yqsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fNECorrections> | Twitter<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=_qR2HZ-wRPgar_KdQgXT6ZkSlPKcTwIulVjNFAxYVmKsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fNECorrections>\n",
