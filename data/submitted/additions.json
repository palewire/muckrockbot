City of Oklahoma City, 1995 OK CIV APP 56 (1995): This case held that under the Oklahoma Open Records Act, last meal requests of death row inmates are public records and must be disclosed to the public.\r\n\r\nCQ Roll Call, Inc. v. FDA, 834 F. Supp. 2d 152 (D.D.C. 2011): This case held that under the Freedom of Information Act, records of food and drink consumed by individuals can be considered public records and may be subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of W. Mich. v. Taft, 439 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. 2006): This case held that under the Freedom of Information Act, disclosure of information regarding inmates' food preferences does not invade personal privacy and does not outweigh the public interest in obtaining the information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF or Microsoft Excel.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
