        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOn February 2nd 2023 the Niles Senior Center held a \u201cmurder mystery\" luncheon event. Racist symbols were a part of this organized event. Images from this event were posted to Facebook social media, during Black History Month. (see attachments)\r\n\r\nThese images included a participant wearing a hat with the confederate flag symbol prominently displayed. Another dressed as a caricature of an Indigenous person.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a lawsuit filed against the Village of Niles Senior Center for workplace discrimination and racism. A Black woman who served as Program Coordinator for many years, bringing excellent programming, and beloved by the community, was terminated from her position. \r\n\r\nWe would like to understand why this seems to be a consistent pattern even after years of awareness of racism in our community. \r\n\r\nTo those ends we would like to start with all emails to/from the Niles Senior Center Director Kelly Mickle and emails to/from the Niles Human Resources department between August 1, 2020 and the date this request is processed (inclusive of those dates) that include any of the following keywords:\r\n\r\n\u2013 \"racist\"\r\n\u2013 \"racism\"\r\n\u2013 \"harassment\"\r\n\u2013 \"retaliation\"\r\n\u2013 \"discrimination\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNiles Coalition",
