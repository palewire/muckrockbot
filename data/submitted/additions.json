ICE\u201d or \u201cTLC v. ICE\u201d (NDCal / CA9) \u201cInnovation Law Lab v. ICE\u201d (DNM) \u201cOwen v. ICE\u201d (CDCal) or \u201cStevens v. ICE\u201d (NDIll). \r\n\r\nPlease task a search from May 1, 2022 - the present within the ICE FOIA Office only. \r\n\r\nFor context, ICE is subject to declaratory judgments and/or injunctions in each of these FOIA cases. The purpose of this request is to determine whether the agency has informed its FOIA personnel of the judgments and injunctions that are meant to alter your office\u2019s conduct. \r\n\r\nBecause federal courts have already declared ICE\u2019s current FOIA processing responses unlawful in each each, we request expedited processing under 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest that all statements herein are true and correct under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746. Records sought in this request are necessary to prevent the loss of substantial due process rights available to FOIA requestors \u2014 namely, the right to receive FOIA determinations and promptly access records within the statutorily defined time periods ICE must obey. \r\n\r\nWe make this request on behalf of the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative of Al Otro Lado.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
