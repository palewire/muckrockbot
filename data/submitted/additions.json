Moreover, there is no basis in law for you to \"presume\" that I am no longer interested in my request, or to close it for lack of response from me; case law clearly requires you to fulfill it with your best efforts.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to refuse my request on either basis, please say so explicitly, so that I may immediately appeal your denial.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Postal Regulatory Commission's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nP.S.

The one email in the Commission\u2019s chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in the Commission\u2019s chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in the Commission\u2019s chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has conducted a search, which revealed three responsive records.  We are releasing two records in full and withholding one under FOIA exemption 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) as it contains attorney-client privileged information, and the release of such information will cause foreseeable harm. We do not have any records that are responsive to number 4, and FOIA does not require an agency to create records.  In addition, we are providing the records in PDF as we do not have the ability to securely release records in any other format. We are also sending these via email as uploading documents to a site not approved is a violation of government cybersecurity policy.\r\n\r\nYour request for a fee waiver is moot since fees were not assessed for the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nYou may appeal this response by filing an appeal within ninety (90) days, in the following ways:\r\n\r\nBy filing an appeal at the following address:\r\n\r\nDavid A.

Using the OGIS for mediation does not affect your right to pursue litigation. You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nEmail: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nTel.: 202-741-5770\r\nFax: 202-741-5769\r\n\r\nIf you need further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please do not hesitate to contact the Commission\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Gail Adams, in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nPostal Regulatory Commission\r\nFOIA Public Liaison\r\n901 New York Avenue, NW, Suite 200\r\nWashington, DC 20268-0001\r\nEmail: gail.adams@prc.gov<mailto:gail.adams@prc.gov>\r\nTel.: 202-789-6800\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 25-28.
