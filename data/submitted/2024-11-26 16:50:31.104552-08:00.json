It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\n\r\nGoverns public access to federal agency records and requires \"reasonable searches\" for responsive documents.\r\nFederal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101)\r\n\r\nMandates proper creation, maintenance, and preservation of federal records.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nNARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004)\r\n\r\nAgencies bear the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their search and providing a justification for withholding records.\r\nChurch of Scientology v. IRS, 792 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\r\n\r\nAgencies must conduct a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\n\r\nDefines public interest in government transparency and accountability as fundamental to FOIA.\r\nWolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\r\n\r\nCourts review whether an agency\u2019s FOIA search was conducted in good faith and was adequate in scope.\r\nKissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v. Regional School Unit 26, 928 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2019)\r\n\r\nPublic entities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication.\r\nHale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004)\r\n\r\nAgencies bear the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their search and providing a justification for withholding records.\r\nChurch of Scientology v. IRS, 792 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\r\n\r\nAgencies must conduct a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\n\r\nDefines public interest in government transparency and accountability as fundamental to FOIA.\r\nWolf v.

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v. Regional School Unit 26, 928 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2019)\r\n\r\nPublic entities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication.\r\nHale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004)\r\n\r\nAgencies bear the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their search and providing a justification for withholding records.\r\nChurch of Scientology v. IRS, 792 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\r\n\r\nAgencies must conduct a search \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\r\nDepartment of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989)\r\n\r\nDefines public interest in government transparency and accountability as fundamental to FOIA.\r\nWolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\r\n\r\nCourts review whether an agency\u2019s FOIA search was conducted in good faith and was adequate in scope.\r\nKissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980)\r\n\r\nClarifies agency obligations under FOIA regarding the handling and preservation of federal records.\r\n2. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132)\r\n\r\nProhibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in accessing public services.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nRequires federally funded programs to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\r\n\r\nEstablishes effective communication requirements for public entities under the ADA.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v. Regional School Unit 26, 928 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2019)\r\n\r\nPublic entities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication.\r\nHale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3. Constitutional Protections\r\nKey Provisions:\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the public\u2019s right to access information as an extension of free speech.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees due process and equal protection under the law, including rights to fair access to government processes.\r\nSupremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4. Government Accountability and Oversight\r\nKey Laws:\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\u2013706)\r\n\r\nGoverns the process by which federal agencies operate and ensures accountability for agency actions.\r\nHatch Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7321\u20137326)\r\n\r\nProhibits improper use of federal resources, ensuring ethical operations in federal agencies.\r\nInspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984)\r\n\r\nAgencies must justify actions under statutory frameworks, and judicial deference is contingent on compliance with the law.\r\nMassachusetts v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004)\r\n\r\nReinforces the right to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to public services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985)\r\n\r\nProhibits policies or actions that disproportionately exclude individuals with disabilities from accessing public benefits.\r\nDoe v.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995)\r\n\r\nReinforces transparency as a principle integral to constitutional accountability.\r\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011)\r\n\r\nFederal agencies must comply with ADA requirements when responding to requests from individuals with disabilities.\r\n3.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It incorporates all required ADA accommodations and compliance demands, as well as a specific framework for remediation.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nThis appeal identifies four critical deficiencies in CMS\u2019s response:\r\n\r\nFailure to Conduct a Reasonable Search: CMS did not perform a search reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, violating FOIA.\r\nNon-Compliance with ADA Mandates: CMS failed to honor my ADA accommodations, violating federal law and constitutional protections under the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nBreach of Constitutional Accountability: CMS\u2019s actions undermine rights protected under the Constitution, including due process, equal protection, and transparency obligations.\r\nViolation of Public Accountability Principles: The absence of responsive records raises systemic concerns about transparency in federally funded programs.\r\nI request immediate remediation, including a new search, explicit ADA compliance measures, and systemic reforms to ensure future accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Grounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Search\r\nFOIA requires that federal agencies conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant records (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)). CMS\u2019s claim that no responsive records exist is inconsistent with its statutory oversight role under the Medicaid program.\r\n\r\nStatutory Obligations Require Record Existence:\r\nCMS is required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 to maintain comprehensive documentation of Medicaid waivers, including:\r\n\r\nWaiver applications submitted by the State of Connecticut.\r\nCMS review and approval documentation.\r\nCorrespondence with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS).\r\nReports on program outcomes, compliance, and funding.\r\nInsufficient Search Methodology:\r\nCMS failed to confirm whether relevant offices, databases, and third-party contractors were included in the search. Offices likely to have responsive records include:\r\n\r\nMedicaid & CHIP Operations Group (MCOG)\r\nCenter for Medicaid & CHIP Services (CMCS)\r\nFreedom of Information Group (FOIG)\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause guarantees fair and equal treatment under the law. CMS\u2019s inadequate search undermines transparency and access to government-held information, a foundational principle of due process.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConduct a new search that includes all relevant offices, databases, and systems.\r\nProvide documentation detailing the methodology, including:\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nPersonnel and divisions consulted.\r\nCorrespondence with contractors and state agencies.\r\nExplain why records required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.12 and 441.302 are not available.\r\n2. Non-Compliance with ADA Mandates\r\nAs an individual with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I requested specific ADA accommodations in my FOIA request to ensure effective communication. CMS\u2019s failure to provide these accommodations violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160.\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Requested:\r\n\r\nAll correspondence embedded directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nSimplified summaries of complex records or correspondence.\r\nScreen-reader compatible PDFs for any attachments.\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and designed to reduce cognitive load and ensure equal access. CMS\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a direct violation of my rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nPrecedent Supporting ADA Accommodations:\r\nIn Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced that individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations that ensure their ability to participate fully in government processes.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Implications:\r\nBy failing to provide effective communication, CMS violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection and the Supremacy Clause, as federal ADA regulations preempt non-compliance.\r\n\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA accommodations in all future correspondence, including:\r\nUse of the MuckRock platform as my sole communication method.\r\nEmbedding all text directly in email bodies for accessibility.\r\nProvide a revised response to this appeal in full compliance with ADA standards.\r\nOutline corrective measures CMS will implement to prevent future ADA violations.\r\n3. Breach of Constitutional Accountability\r\nTransparency and accountability are constitutional principles that underpin government operations. CMS\u2019s inadequate response infringes on several key protections:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Public access to government-held information is an extension of free speech and a prerequisite for meaningful participation in democracy.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: CMS\u2019s failure to provide a fair and equitable process for accessing records violates due process and equal protection rights.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI): Federal statutes, including FOIA and the ADA, preempt any agency practice that undermines compliance.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nAcknowledge constitutional obligations to provide transparency and accountability.\r\nConfirm that all processes comply with constitutional and statutory protections.\r\n4. Violation of Public Accountability Principles\r\nThe Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program involves federal funds allocated to support individuals with disabilities. Records related to this program are essential for:\r\n\r\nEnsuring compliance with program goals.\r\nSafeguarding taxpayer dollars.\r\nProtecting the rights of vulnerable populations.\r\nPotential Implications of Missing Records:\r\nCMS\u2019s inability to locate responsive records raises systemic concerns about:\r\n\r\nRecord retention practices under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101).\r\nOversight and compliance failures with Medicaid program goals.\r\nRequested Remedy:\r\n\r\nConfirm whether third-party contractors or state agencies were consulted during the search.\r\nProvide responsive records or justify their absence.\r\nImplement systemic reforms to improve transparency and accountability.\r\nEscalation Pathways\r\nIf this appeal is not resolved satisfactorily, I will escalate the matter through the following channels:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: For ADA non-compliance.\r\nOffice of Inspector General (HHS-OIG): For investigation into systemic failures.\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees: To address broader accountability issues.\r\nJudicial Review: Filing suit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nCMS\u2019s response fails to meet its obligations under FOIA, the ADA, and the Constitution. I request:\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search for responsive records, with detailed documentation of the process.\r\nImmediate compliance with ADA accommodations, including exclusive use of the MuckRock platform for all correspondence.\r\nA revised response to this appeal addressing the deficiencies outlined.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this appeal and provide a full response no later than 20 business days from receipt, as required under FOIA. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\nDesiree Gaynor, CMS FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

VI)\r\n\r\nFederal laws, such as FOIA and the ADA, preempt state or agency actions that violate these statutes.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nLane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477 (1963)\r\n\r\nEnsures federal programs operate in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with constitutional protections.\r\nRosenberger v.

Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803)\r\n\r\nEstablishes judicial review as a mechanism to ensure government compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.\r\n4.

App.)\r\n\r\nEstablishes mechanisms for independent oversight and investigation of agency misconduct.\r\nRelevant Cases:\r\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn. Offender number or other unique identifier for each individual arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until\r\n\r\nthe day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). I request an extract of the database to be provided as an electronic spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, or .ods format). If such format is unavailable, we request the extract of the database to be provided in a searchable, machine-readable form, as per 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u201d Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following descriptions of the data in each column. This may be provided as clear, descriptive column headers in the database extract or in a separate document:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\nm. Incident number or other unique identifier for each arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nn. Offender number or other unique identifier for each individual arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until\r\n\r\nthe day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D. Research Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration k.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n617-373-5862\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry or FBI association with a prominent Seattle-area boxer and associate of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party named Kenno Carlos. Kenno Carlos is deceased and thus privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. Mr. Kenno Carlos was born on November 28th of 1938 in Capitol Heights in Maryland, and died on December 29th of 2008. A photograph of his headstone and burial plot in the Forest Lawn cemetery in Seattle is available online: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/159350303/kenno-carlos\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd of 1968 Kenno Carlos was arrested in a flag burning episode in Seattle that made local news: https://www.historylink.org/File/1456\r\n\r\nAccording to evidence presented by the House Committee on Internal Security in 1970, Mr. Kenno Carlos of Seattle was included in a publicly released list of individuals, \"identified as Seattle Panther Party members or associates who, at various times between April 1968 and March 1970, participated in Panther functions regularly.\" A link to that document from the House Committee on Internal Security can be found here: https://blackfreedom.proquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blackpanther20.pdf\r\n\r\nOther known aliases for Kenno Carlos, according to the congressional report, include the names Joseph Edward Hall and Charlie Reno. In December of 1972 news articles describe Kenno Carlos boxing under the name \"Big\" Charlie Reno: https://www.boxingforum24.com/threads/ken-norton-vs-big-charlie-reno-december-13-1972.433709/ \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the boxer Kenno Carlos from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Kenno Carlos held by the Seattle office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases (including \"Joseph Edward Hall\" and \"Charlie Reno\"), nicknames (\"Big Charlie\"), code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Kenno Carlos.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Kenno Carlos. Possible bureau documentation on Kenno Carlos would likely include the flag burning episode and associated media coverage, Black Panther material and documents, etc. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nI am writing to formally appeal the Department of Justice's response dated November 25, 2024, to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request concerning documents related to the DOJ's investigation of Nvidia Corporation's position in the AI chip market.\r\n\r\n+ Legal Basis for Appeal\r\n\r\nThe agency's blanket withholding of all requested documents under Exemption 7(A) is overly broad and fails to meet the specific criteria established by federal courts. In Mapother v. Department of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the court held that an agency must provide a \"substantially more specific\" justification for withholding documents than a generalized claim of potential interference with enforcement proceedings.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n1) Overbroad Application of Exemption 7(A):\r\n\r\nIn ACLU v. Department of Justice, 655 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court emphasized that Exemption 7(A) requires a demonstration of \"foreseeable harm\" from disclosure. The DOJ's response does not specify in detail how the release of each withheld document would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings. Without a detailed explanation, the exemption is improperly applied.\r\n\r\n2) Failure to Comply with the Segregability Requirement:\r\n\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b), agencies are required to release all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of requested records. In Founding Church of Scientology v. Smith, 721 F.2d 828 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court mandated that agencies must conduct a thorough review to segregate and release non-exempt information. The DOJ's blanket withholding suggests that no such effort was made.\r\n\r\n3) Misapplication of Other Potential Exemptions:\r\n\r\nWhile the DOJ cited Exemption 7(A), it did not address whether other exemptions might apply. Anticipating potential claims under Exemptions 4 or 5, I assert that the disclosure would not reveal trade secrets or privileged inter-agency communications, as the requested documents pertain to the agency's activities and not proprietary information from Nvidia.\r\n\r\n4) Compelling Public Interest\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), emphasized the critical role of transparency in maintaining an informed public. The investigation into Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market has significant implications for competition, consumer choice, and technological innovation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have highlighted concerns about monopolistic practices and their impact on the economy and national security. Disclosure of the DOJ's investigative actions will enhance public understanding of how the government addresses these pressing issues, fostering trust and accountability.\r\n\r\n+ Requested Relief\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that the Office of Information Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Conduct a Document-by-Document Review:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), please perform a detailed review of each withheld document to assess the applicability of Exemption 7(A) on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n2) Provide a Detailed Vaughn Index:\r\n\r\nSupply a comprehensive index describing each withheld document, the exemption claimed, and a specific justification for its withholding. This will facilitate a meaningful review and appeal process.\r\n\r\n3) Release All Reasonably Segregable Information:\r\n\r\nDisclose all portions of the documents that do not meet the criteria for exemption, as mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\n4) Demonstrate Specific, Articulable Harm:\r\n\r\nClearly articulate how the disclosure of each specific document would cause foreseeable harm to enforcement proceedings, in line with the standards set forth in ACLU v. Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or clarifications, please feel free to contact me. I am willing to assist in any way to facilitate the processing of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKyle Wiggers",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThose pertaining to the lobbying activities of OpenAI Inc. (EIN: 81-0861541). Specifically, I am seeking:\r\n\r\nDetailed records related to the organization's lobbying expenditures as reported on Schedule C (Form 990, see attached) for tax years 2020 through 2023, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\na. Documentation detailing how the reported direct lobbying expenditures were allocated and spent.\r\nb. Information on specific legislation or representatives that were the focus of lobbying efforts.\r\nc. Records of grassroots lobbying activities and associated expenses.\r\nd. Any communications or records related to the organization's lobbying strategies and objectives.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation for the following specific expenditures reported on Schedule C:\r\n\r\n2020: $799,527 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2021: $213,956 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2022: $204,415 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n2023: $293,166 (total lobbying expenditures)\r\n\r\n+ Legal Authority and Justification:\r\n\r\nThis request is supported by legal precedents emphasizing the importance of transparency in nonprofit organizations' lobbying activities:\r\n\r\nPublic Citizen Health Research Group v. Department of Health, Education & Welfare, 477 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1979): Established that records relating to nonprofit organizations influencing public policy are subject to disclosure under FOIA when they concern matters of significant public interest.\r\n\r\nNational Western Life Insurance Co. v. United States, 512 F. Supp. 454 (N.D. Tex. 1980): Supported the disclosure of IRS records pertaining to exempt organizations' activities affecting public policy.\r\n\r\nTax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1997): Affirmed that the public has a strong interest in records showing how tax-exempt organizations operate and influence public policy, necessitating disclosure unless records clearly fall under FOIA exemptions.\r\n\r\nMultiple Access Ltd. v. FDA, 591 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1979): Reinforced that federal agencies must disclose records unless they fall under specific FOIA exemptions. The requested information pertains to a 501(c)(3) organization's use of resources for lobbying activities, which is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1976): The Supreme Court held that FOIA's basic policy of full agency disclosure supports the release of records unless they are exempt under clearly defined statutory language.\r\n\r\nLepelletier v. FDIC, 164 F.3d 37, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1999): Emphasized the public's significant interest in understanding how nonprofit organizations utilize resources to influence public policy, especially in emerging technology sectors.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it will contribute significantly to public understanding of how a prominent AI research organization utilizes its resources to influence policy in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\n+ Format of Records:\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in electronic format (e.g., PDF or Word documents) where possible, preferably sent to my email address.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKyle Wiggers",

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

It directly addresses systemic failures in Medicaid oversight, ADA enforcement, and whistleblower protections\u2014issues central to the lives of millions of Americans and critical to the integrity of federal and state programs. By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
