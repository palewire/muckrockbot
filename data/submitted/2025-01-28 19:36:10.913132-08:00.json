        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken.

DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

Krosoczka\r\n\t\u2022\tAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue by George M. Johnson\r\n\t\u2022\tThe Hate U Give by Angie Thomas\r\n\r\nThis request applies to records created or received during the time frame January 27, 2024, to January 27, 2025. Specifically, I request:\r\n\t1.\tEmails and Metadata:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll emails, text messages, memos, and reports sent or received by school district officials, administrators, or staff related to the review, challenge, or removal of books, including but not limited to the titles listed above.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata (e.g., sender, recipient, timestamps, subject lines) for all communications discussing the books or related decisions.\r\n\t2.\tComplaints and Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any complaints, formal or informal, received by the school district regarding books, including but not limited to the listed titles, from parents, guardians, or other stakeholders.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny correspondence between school district officials and complainants regarding the books.\r\n\t3.\tInternal Memos and Decision-Making Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal memos or reports related to the review, challenge, or removal of books.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords identifying the individuals, committees, or boards involved in making final decisions regarding the challenge or removal of books.\r\n\t\u2022\tMeeting minutes, agendas, and relevant documentation related to these decisions.\r\n\t4.\tLegal Counsel Communication:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of communication between the school district and legal counsel regarding the review, challenge, or removal of books.

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), public access to records related to government actions is essential to ensure accountability and transparency.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata and Communications: As reinforced in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), metadata is an integral part of electronic records and must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tPublic Interest: FOIA\u2019s principles, reaffirmed in Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), prioritize transparency when no explicit exemptions apply.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request addresses significant public interest in understanding how the Wappingers Central School District handles book challenges and removals. These records are essential for understanding decision-making processes and ensuring the district operates in a transparent and accountable manner.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information will significantly enhance public understanding of the district\u2019s decision-making processes regarding book challenges.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: As upheld in Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), FOIA fee waivers should be granted for requests that contribute to public knowledge of government activities.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within 20 business days. If any part of this request is unclear, I am available at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification or to discuss the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), public access to records related to government actions is essential to ensure accountability and transparency.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata and Communications: As reinforced in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), metadata is an integral part of electronic records and must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tPublic Interest: FOIA\u2019s principles, reaffirmed in Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), prioritize transparency when no explicit exemptions apply.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request addresses significant public interest in the impartiality and transparency of government actions, particularly concerning Ed Martin\u2019s decisions as Interim U.S. Attorney. Given the political and historical context of these cases, the requested records are crucial for understanding the integrity of federal investigations and ensuring public trust in the Department of Justice\u2019s actions.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing the public\u2019s understanding of the Department of Justice\u2019s operations and decision-making processes during critical and high-profile cases.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: As upheld in Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), FOIA fee waivers should be granted for requests that contribute to public knowledge of government activities.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to matters of significant public interest involving potential political influence on federal investigations. These records are critical for ongoing reporting and public understanding of governmental actions and their potential implications for justice and accountability.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within 20 business days. If any part of this request is unclear, I am available at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification or to discuss the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G.

Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2.
