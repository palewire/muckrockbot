Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "08/12/2024 \r\n\r\nAndrew Free \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR136588 \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2024-ICAP-00127 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Appeal on remand. You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

Both Eppolito and Caracappa are widely reported as deceased (please see the attached report of the New York Daily News). As such, there are no longer privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7, nor are there any privacy concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Eppolito:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 129-36\r\nBOP Registration Number: 04596-748\r\nDate of Birth: 7/22/48\r\nDate of Death: 11/03/2019\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Caracappa:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 115-32\r\nBOP Register Number: 04597-748\r\nDate of Birth: 11/12/41\r\nDate of Death: 04/08/2017\r\n\r\nPlease return a result for a query of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS) using each aforementioned subject's name and (where necessary) accompanying identifying numbers or dates of birth. \r\n\r\nPlease return both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies, across all systems of records. This includes records within the following systems of records (not exclusively): Automated Intelligence Records System (Pathfinder); Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS); Grants of Confidentiality Files (GCF); Operations Files; and Security Files.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the DEA has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

        "communication": "Mrs. Starr, Jupiter Police Department,\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phones from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, It is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or a unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (ie call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

You incorrectly suggested that the Town had not provided you the information necessary to access those records\u2014we had\u2014and requested that the records either be uploaded to a website unknown to the Town or provided as an email attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the size/volume of your responsive documents, providing them via email is not a viable option. Further, the Town will not deviate from its standard procedures and upload records to an unknown third-party website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any event, we note that as of 10/31/2024, you had accessed and downloaded the responsive records produced to you on 10/16/24. If this is incorrect, we again remind you that you can create your own username and password for the file transfer site so that you can access the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to access the Town\u2019s file transfer site, the responsive documents can alternatively be burned to a disc and picked up in person at the Jupiter Police Department.\r\n\r\n\u200bRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:44f39992-31b4-4f0a-99b9-fefbb9edde92]<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.jupiter.fl.us%2f&c=E,1,_5S1lqS7CtguFkStARSlhAuYt_miT_eYrqEFvXblY_9dIRn7ijT95pA65yPN4MlI3E7T3avPU3YIVpfqf6KwniNfS0w6OeNS_6cVRtB8w3gPW9o,&typo=1>[cid:f274a37b-290e-45c8-9976-a368e0b07f54]\r\n\r\n\r\nMagdalena Rogers\r\n\r\nRecords Manager\r\n\r\nPhone: 561 741 2253\r\n\r\nFax: 561 746 4545\r\n\r\nEmail: 1188@jupiter.fl.us\r\n\r\n196 Military Trail,\r\n\r\nJupiter, Florida 33458\r\n\r\n*****CONFIDENTIAL*****\r\nThe information in this email is intended specifically for the person(s) to which it is addresses and does contain confidential, EXEMPT information from F.S.S 119 (Florida Public Records Law), and/or otherwise privileged material.

We are currently experiencing a high volume of open requests (there are currently 1,370 open requests) and many require additional research such as yours. We are interpreting this request as email records related to the provided domain and therefore we will conduct email search for records from January 1, 2021 through August 30, 2023 with the keywords: @clearview.ai @mg.clearview.ai Please let me know by September 21, 2023, if this clarification is incorrect.\u00a0 If we do not hear from you by then, we will proceed our research with these search parameters. Once we have identified the records we will begin reviewing and preparing them for release. We anticipate our first installment of records to you on or before November 1, 2023 . If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know. If we are able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly do so. \r\nYour request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120 . Please visit our website  and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request.

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause this installment of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

I am also not required to respond to false statements made by your agency,  and thus far I have declined to do so.\r\n\r\nYour false statement of 05-22-2024:\r\n\r\n\"I am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments\r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, no installments have gone unclaimed. This statement is false.

Emails with attachments have provided the name of attachments, is this sufficient to meet your request?\r\n2. You were provided installments related to personal files part of this request with adequate time to review, has this part of the request been filled to you meet your expectations?\r\n\r\nOnce KCDA is able to gain more clarity from you, will be able to continue providing installments.\"\r\n\r\nRESPONSE:\r\n\r\n1. Have all records responsive to this request been produced? Have all agency claims of exemption been properly documented and have contemporaneous exemption logs  been provided? This is the standard for which records responsive to this request are required to be produced.\r\n\r\n2. The original records request does not reference \"expectations\" of any kind.  Have all records responsive to this request been produced? Have all agency claims of exemption been properly documented and have contemporaneous exemption logs  been provided?\r\n\r\nORIGINAL PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST DATED 10-11-2022:\r\n\r\nPursuant to Washington State Public Records Law RCW 42.56, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUEST PART 1: THREE (3) EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL FILES\r\n\r\nI request the complete non-exempt Personnel File, including all payroll files, timesheets, absence & tardiness, disciplinary actions, W-2's, travel and expense reimbursements, any and all additional appropriations on behalf of (for example conference attendance reimbursements, hotel and flight vouchers, etc.) resumes, letters of recommendation and all other nonexempt hiring-related documents, position descriptions, compensation records, information on benefit enrollment, attendance records, performance evaluations and information about all other employment-related actions (e.g., promotions, training, or any disciplinary action), and any other non-exempt job-related information available for the for the following current or former employee of the King County Directors Association:\r\n\r\nDAVID SCOTT MALHALKO\r\nYOHAN LEE\r\nKAREN KAY DESKIN\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records available for the time period 2017 \u2013 Present.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUEST PART 2: EMAIL RECORDS 2017-PRESENT\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of the email server .PST file for the email account associated with the following three (3) email addresses for the time period 2017 \u2013 Present:\r\n\r\ndmalhalko@kcda.org\r\nylee@kcda.org\r\nkdeskin@kcda.org\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of these email records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing responsive email records in REVERSE chronological order by date, producing the most recent messages and records first.\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR RESPONSIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\nYour agency\u2019s search for responsive email records should involve a good-faith search of all public employee personal devices reasonably believed to contain requested responsive records regardless the type of device or account from which the communication was generated or where the device or data is stored (including personal devices such as personal cell phones, laptops, tablets, and/or computers etc. used from home to conduct public business during the COVID-19 Pandemic). Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nAlso, please provide a reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavit attesting to the nature and extent of any search of any privately owned public employee computer, device, or account.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION OF RESPONSIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all requested email records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records as stored in their NATIVE .pst (personal storage table) format as stored on agency email servers.\r\n\r\nIf these email records cannot be produced in this NATIVE .pst format, explain in exact technical and procedural detail under the Washington State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) WHY these electronic records cannot be produced as the electronic records are NATIVELY stored.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure any agency redactions or exemptions claimed in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Again, this request does not seek a list of any kind and is NOT FOR A COMMERICAL PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nPRIOR DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nIf any potentially relevant records have been destroyed, please provide copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation pertaining to, mentioning, or describing said transfer or destruction, including, but not limited to, a statement that your agency has no additional copies of the records in question.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure any agency redactions or exemptions claimed in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\n\r\n*** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 17th and 18th were sent on 03/29/2024 and 4/19/2024 respectively, neither of which have been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause these installments of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nLast week, I submitted a request for records related to an incident on November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629. The original request sought the following: Incident Reports, 911 Audio, Dispatch Recordings, Body Cam Footage, and a CAD Log. However, the request was denied in full on the grounds of being overly broad in scope. I would like to emphasize that, under FOIA guidelines, if certain portions of a request are deemed too broad or are otherwise exempt, the department should not deny the request in full. Instead, the agency is obligated to produce any non-exempt records that are reasonably identifiable and within scope. Additionally, Incident Reports are a standard type of document routinely requested and disclosed by this agency. In fact, I have previously received such reports from the Chicago Police Department without the need for separate or narrowed requests. I respectfully request that this standard practice be applied to this case as well. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, I am submitting a revised, narrower request:\r\n\r\nIncident Report: Any incident or police report(s) prepared in connection to a November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Dhruv: \r\n \r\nThank you for your interest in information from the Chicago Police Department. Your FOIA request has been received and is being processed. Your FOIA Center reference number for tracking purposes is: P998067-111124 \r\nYou have requested the following records: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nLast week, I submitted a request for records related to an incident on November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629. The original request sought the following: Incident Reports, 911 Audio, Dispatch Recordings, Body Cam Footage, and a CAD Log. However, the request was denied in full on the grounds of being overly broad in scope. I would like to emphasize that, under FOIA guidelines, if certain portions of a request are deemed too broad or are otherwise exempt, the department should not deny the request in full. Instead, the agency is obligated to produce any non-exempt records that are reasonably identifiable and within scope. Additionally, Incident Reports are a standard type of document routinely requested and disclosed by this agency. In fact, I have previously received such reports from the Chicago Police Department without the need for separate or narrowed requests. I respectfully request that this standard practice be applied to this case as well.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, I am submitting a revised, narrower request:\r\n\r\nIncident Report: Any incident or police report(s) prepared in connection to a November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchicago-police-department-503%252Fincident-reports-176161%252F%253Femail%253Dfoia%252540chicagopolice.org&url_auth_token=AAAjxrjtT_zHEilE4EDjtDqhcJU%3A1tAf2c%3A6tH9D5zwE-n6tD3r5I3bR24Risl1gvmr-fkmcKocTrg \r\nChicago Police Department (CPD) responds to all public records requests in accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. \u00a0If further time is needed to assemble and copy all documents responsive to your FOIA request, we will contact you with a time estimate and a request to extend.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

        "communication": "Dear Susan Dyer Reynolds,\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are following up on a records request that was sent from \u201cBelle Reve\u201d from the muckrock email address above.  The Office of the Mayor responded to this request on September 4 and September 18.  See attached file entitled \u201cRe_Sunshine Great Highway.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our response of September 18, we provided five records responsive to the original request.  Two of those records contained redactions.  We set forth the bases of those redactions in the body of our response.  We understand that your Immediate Disclosure Request, sent Sunday and therefore deemed received today, seeks unredacted versions of those two records.\r\n\r\nThe redacted versions of those files are linked in the attached.  We cannot provide unredacted versions.  As we clearly explained in our September 18 email, \u201cthe record entitled \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert \u2026\u201d has been redacted to protect personal contact information.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700.\u201d  As shown in that file, we redacted the personal email contact information of a member of the public to protect their privacy.  Those redactions were identified, along with the statutory citations to justify them, in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nWe also clearly explained that \u201c[t]he record entitled \u201cRE_Draft Great Highway \u2026\u201d has been redacted pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7927.705; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 954; S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.21(k).\u201d  All of the redactions in that file were made because all of the redacted portions are communications made for purposes of soliciting or receiving legal advice and are therefore protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  The statutory citations to justify these redactions are also clearly provided in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Mayor\u2019s Office satisfied our obligations under SFSO 67.27 by clearly identifying and justifying the redactions in these files with citations to specific statutory authority.  We also provided a clear reference to the justifications for the withholdings in each document, as we provided statements for each document explaining the redactions in those documents, as required by SFSO 67.26.  We also kept withholding to a minimum; only the portions of the \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert\u201d document with personal contact information and the portions of the \u201cRe_Draft Great Highway\u201d document containing attorney/client privileged communications were withheld.  See SFSO 67.26.  No additional redactions were made.\r\n\r\nThus, we have provided you with responsive records and properly justified the redactions in those records.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have located additional records responsive to your request.  See them attached here.  Note that the record entitled \u201c00. Notes -  Great Highway Parade 6.29.24_Redacted\u201d contains redactions of certain phone numbers which have been withheld to protect personal privacy and because they constitute official information subject to the official information privilege.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700; Cal. Evid. Code 1040.\r\n\r\nWe have not withheld any records in their entirety in response to your request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

However, such requests are reserved for requests that are \u201csimple, routine and readily answerable.\u201d See San Francisco Administrative Code Section 67.25(a).  Your request seeks communications between anyone in the Mayor\u2019s Office and five different individuals with no subject matter limitation over an unlimited period of time.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an immediate disclosure request and is being processed as a regular request.\r\n\r\nWe have invoked a 14 day extension from the original due date due to the need to consult with another City department.  See Cal. Gov. Code 7922.535(a) and S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.25(b).

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Homeland Security,\r\n\r\nIn official capacity on behalf of Fiat Fiendum only, not in personal capacity, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3):\r\n\r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency,  corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1)\r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\nMy request is literally for all records you have previously released under FOIA, and for the associated records about the requests under which they were previously released.\r\n\r\nA major objective of this request is to get you to publish all released FOIA records, and all records about requests resulting in those releases, to your electronic FOIA \"reading room\", pursuant to 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D). There is therefore one exclusion: this request does not cover records that are already publicly available on your electronic FOIA reading room.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and disclosed the records for item 1, and your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for item 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* by definition, FOIA releases are of public interest, this is exclusively about prior public releases, and making them more widely available advances the goals of the Act.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please bear in mind the statutory obligation under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) to post records to your electronic reading room if they have been \"requested\" 3 or more times, and released at least once under 552(a)(3).\r\n\r\nBy definition, all records responsive to item 1 of my request have been requested at least one previous time, and were released at least once under 552(a)(3). This request is at least one more \"request\" (and that clause is not conditioned on having achieved a release). There may well have been another prior \"request\". If there was, this request is at least the third, and therefore triggers the mandatory publication requirement. If not, I would nevertheless urge you to exercise your discretion to release them publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

Our office received your request on 10/28/2024.  Specifically, you requested: \r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1) \r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances under 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  The DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.11(k) set forth six factors DHS must evaluate to determine whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met:  (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government,\u201d (2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities, (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons, (4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \u201csignificant,\u201d (5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and (6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. \r\n\r\nUpon review of the subject matter of your request, and an evaluation of the six factors identified above, DHS has determined that it will conditionally grant your request for a fee waiver.  The fee waiver determination will be based upon a sampling of the responsive documents received from the various DHS program offices as a result of the searches conducted in response to your FOIA request.  DHS will, pursuant to DHS FOIA regulations applicable to non-commercial requesters, provide two hours of search time and process the first 100 pages at no charge to you.  If upon review of these documents, DHS determines that the disclosure of the information contained in those documents does not meet the factors permitting DHS to waive the fees, then DHS will at that time either deny your request for a fee waiver entirely, or will allow for a percentage reduction in the amount of the fees corresponding to the amount of relevant material found that meets the factors allowing for a fee waiver.  In either case, DHS will promptly notify you of its final decision regarding your request for a fee waiver and provide you with the responsive records as required by applicable law. \r\n\r\nIn the event that your fee waiver is denied, and you determine that you still want the records, provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester you will be charged for any search time and duplication beyond the free two hours and 100 pages mentioned in the previous paragraph.  You will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication and search time at the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  In the event that your fee waiver is denied, we will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.  This office will contact you before accruing any additional fees. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records.  If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.  Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.  We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-HQFO-00669.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743.",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024. This request is expressly limited to Amtrak's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided. Please provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization). Please provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information. Please provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction. I request fee waiver, because * Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit; * this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes; * these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and * these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance. In the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees. Please be sure to provide: * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information * 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number * 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, Sai President, Fiat Fiendum, Inc. P.S. Sai is my full legal name.. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis request has been issued tracking number 25-FOI-00027.  Please reference this number in all correspondence and communications with this office. \r\n\r\nItem 2 (spam) is attached.\r\n\r\nItems 1 and 3 are being withheld under FOIA Exemption 5, Attorney-Client Priviliege.  \r\n\r\nExemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act protects \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" Courts have construed this somewhat opaque language to \"exempt those documents, and only those documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Amtrak\u2019s FOIA regulations (49 CFR 701.10), if you do not agree with Amtrak\u2019s decision, you may file an appeal with Byl Herrmann, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary, within ninety days (90) of the date of this letter, specifying the relevant facts and the basis for your appeal.  Your appeal may be mailed to Mr. Herrmann\u2019s attention:  National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Law Department, One Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20001.  The President and CEO of Amtrak has delegated authority to the General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary for the rules and compliance to the FOIA.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFOIA Officer\"",

I appeal your refusal of my form and format request as to item 2, and your constructive denial of item 4.\r\n\r\nAs for item 2, you stated that you were providing the email in full, and sent it as a PDF (within a zip file). By exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests \u2014 and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization. I did not consent to you making new, worse records in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email in one of the native electronic email formats listed; any email software will save to them easily.\r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\nAs for item 4, you simply did not respond at all. I therefore appeal your constructive denial for lack of any basis.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

You had asked earlier that we let you know an estimate of final cost. The actual amount cannot be determined ahead of time. However many of the records are native electronic files that won\u2019t require printing or scanning. With that, overall estimate is under $300.  We will invoice you as production costs equal $5.00 or more.\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D908BC.8AF66E20]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616\r\nEmail:  cherylpo@ckschools.org",

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))\r\n\r\nThe BPDA has exercised (1) exemption in reviewing your request:\r\n\r\n*Privacy Exemption: We have redacted the personal email addresses belonging\r\nto individuals that appear in the responsive records. When redacting\r\npersonal email addresses, the Planning Department relied upon the second\r\nclause of the privacy exemption set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). It is\r\nthe position of the Planning Department that the release of personal email\r\naddresses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\ntaking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\ninformation constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\npersonal email addresses are not typically otherwise available for public\r\nconsumption. In weighing the protection of privacy interests versus the\r\npublic interest in disclosure, the Planning Department ultimately\r\ndetermines that providing this information would amount to an unwarranted\r\nintrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any public interest\r\nin the disclosure of personal email addresses does not outweigh the privacy\r\ninterest held by the individuals.  *\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

Please cite this number in any\r\nfuture communications with our office regarding your request.\r\n\r\nIn your request you asked for the following:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll available calendars, daily itineraries, and schedules of activities\r\nfor Kathy Benedetto, the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, from March 1, 2017 through the date this request is processed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.

See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\r\n2.39. If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements,\r\nour processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the\r\ncost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

The\r\nComplex track is for requests that can be processed in twenty-one to\r\nsixty workdays. The Exceptional/Voluminous track is for requests requiring\r\nmore than sixty workdays for processing. The Expedited track is for\r\nrequests that\r\nhave been granted expedited processing. Within each track, requests are\r\nusually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nThis request falls into the complex track.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at BLM_WO_FOIA@blm.gov or\r\n202-912-7650.
