Mayor Adams served with the department from 1984 to 2006. I am requesting the following records under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL):\r\n\r\nAll records related to disciplinary actions taken against Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department, including disciplinary files and logs.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to changes, edits, and copies of the responsive documents identified in item 1 above.\r\n\r\nA list of all individuals who had access to the records identified in items 1 and 2 above during Eric Adams' tenure with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the public, I have a right to access these records to gain a better understanding of the professional conduct and performance of now Mayor Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold, redact, or destroy information related to this request will result in legal action and complaint.
