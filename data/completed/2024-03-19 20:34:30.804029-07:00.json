I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records responsive to Cobwebs Technologies and Tangles.\r\n\r\nTangles is identified in a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis titled \"Operations in Portland\". This was report was first issued on April 20, 2021 but a revised version was published by Senator Ron Wyden on his website on October 27, 2022 (https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/I&A%20and%20OGC%20Portland%20Reports.pdf). The revised report states on page 55 that Tangles is a \"social media aggregation tool\" that was used by DHS Open Source Collection Operations to compile information on individuals attending the 2020 George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon using \"available social media profiles.\"\r\n\r\nCobwebs Technologies has publicly acknowledged itself as the creator of Tangles on its website (https://cobwebs.com/using-web-intelligence-for-criminal-investigations/), which states Tangles is a \"web intelligence platform\" that can \"obtain precise and unrivaled web intelligence in the open and dark web in a fraction of the time it used to take.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all responsive records including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Current and previous contracts with Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Initial Bid Documents\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Procurement Request Packages\r\n\r\n- Change Order Requests issued by either DHS or Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Privacy impact assessments for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Product manuals for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Instructional materials or presentations by Cobwebs Technologies and/or for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Use policies and standard operating procedures for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Data retention policies for Tangles\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

In that communication, the Assistant FOIA Officer stated DHS(I&A) would need to invoke a 10-day extension on top of the traditional 20 business day FOIA response period. Given that the acknowledgment letter was dated for May 31, 2023, the full 30 business days would have expired on July 12, 2023. As of July 14, 2023, I have yet to receive any follow-up communications from DHS(I&A) regarding FOIA request 2023-IAFO-00273. Therefore, I am requesting an update on the status of this request.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing the neo-nazi website titled White Honor,\r\n    hosted at WhiteHonor.com, including but not limited to references located in\r\n    cross references such as 266N-NK-116993 or records relating either of the\r\n    cyber incidents described in the attachments.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For similar responsive records on Use of Force data from January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021, please visit request number #21-9649.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per your communication on February 13, 2022, below is our previous communication from February 1, 2022:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Use of force (UOF) data dating from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. This data should include the case number, incident date, incident time, suspect injured indicator, suspect injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), suspect age, suspect gender, suspect ethnicity, suspect weapon type, incident area occurred, whether the officer was injured, force type, and most importantly, badge number associated with the officers involved.\r\n\r\n2. All police shifts for each employee (identified by badge number) from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. This should include the time of start and end for each shift, the date of the shift, and the corresponding badge number of the employee.\r\n\r\n3. Employee demographics for all employees employed from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2021. All badge numbers linked to the corresponding race, gender, and age if available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #1 of your request, the records you are seeking have been previously provided in another request (see:\u00a0https://lacity.nextrequest.com/requests/21-9649) for Use of Force data for time period January 1, 2014 to October 28, 2021.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the following fields are what has been provided: incident date, incident time, area occurred, case number, suspect ethnicity, suspect age, suspect gender, suspect injuries force related (yes or no), suspect injury type description, suspect weapon type description, employee ethnicity, employee injuries force related (yes or no), employee injury description, incident area occurred, employee unit description, force type description, and finding type.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department did not provide Officer badge numbers as they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Sections 6254(c) and (k) of the Act. Section 6254(c) exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0Section 6254(k), exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Penal Code.\u00a0Penal Code Section 832.7 states that peace officer personnel records and information contained within them are privileged and confidential and cannot be disclosed except through discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1045 of the Evidence Code.\u00a0[See Penal Code Sections 832.5 and 832.7 and Evidence Code Sections 1043 and 1045]. California case law holds that Evidence Code Section 1043\u00a0et seq.\u00a0is the exclusive means to obtain peace officer personnel records, and as such, they are exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Act.\u00a0[See\u00a0City of Hemet v. Superior Court\u00a0(1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th\u00a01411].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, for the sake of transparency the employee\u2019s ethnicity and unit description have been provided.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to Use of Force data for the time period of October 28, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and #3 of your request, please be advised that, pursuant to California Government Code Section 6253(c), we are still searching for, collecting, and/or reviewing the requested records. Should any records be located we will require time to review the requested records for confidential portions that are exempt from disclosure under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255. We will provide you with a response upon completion of our review. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regards to #2 of your request, please note that in order for the Department to provide the requested data, the Department would have to take affirmative steps to locate all potentially responsive documents, related to sworn personnel, and then manually review and extract the specific information that is being sought. Due to the amount of time it would take to do so and based on the same need to retain confidentiality of certain information, the request is unduly burdensome as interpreted by the courts under the \"public interest\" provision of Government Code Section 6255 of the California Public Records Act. Similarly, the Department asserts the exemption due to our belief that disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public. Therefore, we are denying this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Please let me know if I should call about this request. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time and help.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nBeryl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll materials and records describing and sufficient to show/disclose all law enforcement disciplinary records, including materials on allegations of misconduct made and all disciplinary proceedings taken against any law enforcement officer currently or formerly in the employ of this policing agency.\r\n\r\nFor a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record,\u201d please see Section 86 of the New York Public Officers Law. For a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d please refer to the definitions of peace officer found in subdivisions twenty-three and twenty-three-a of section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law and subdivision twenty-four of section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law, as well as the definition of police officer found in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law. \r\n\r\nAs described in the New York Freedom of Information Law, a record is: \r\n\"any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes.\"\r\nRecords kept in a digital or electronic form are also records, would be responsive to this request, and should be provided.\r\n\r\nThe request records are typically required to be retained, in part, under the New York State Records Retention and Disposition Schedule MU-1 (http://www.archives.nysed.gov/records/retention_mu-1), including, but not limited to, item no. 365, which includes: \r\n\"Investigative records and disciplinary proceedings, including but not limited to statement of charge, transcript of hearing, notice of decision, letter of termination or resignation, letter of reinstatement, record of appeal procedure, and correspondence.\" \r\nWhile materials under that schedule have a set retention of 3 years after the final decision rendered, this request and materials responsive to it include *all* records held in the possession of any office or individual employed or formerly employed by this policing agency, including those kept off-site, in digital form, and in personnel files.\r\n\r\nPlease note that any failure to provide all potentially-responsive materials and/or the destruction of materials potentially responsive to this request would be a violation of the spirit of the New York Freedom of Information Law, as well as unlawful under the New York FOIL and the terms of the previously-submitted litigation hold notice.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 all complaints, reports, records of discipline and penalties, aggregate collections of complaint and disciplinary materials (spreadsheets, databases), investigatory materials, relevant related correspondence, photographs, video, other related evidence, proof of discipline or fulfillment of penalties, and all personnel materials (including those used in promotion, contract, and other employment negotiations and considerations) that reference or utilize misconduct allegations or disciplinary materials of any sort.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include all complaints\u2014 internal, external, and civilian \u2014 and include records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident/complaint: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the investigation, investigatory materials, the disposition of the case, and any subsequent materials related to the execution of any resultant discipline. Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - November 30, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants.

Below you'll find an updated version of this FOIL request.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your time and help with this, and I hope you'll let me know if there are any questions I can address.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nBeryl\r\n________________\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, we respectfully request copies of all materials and records pertaining to any and all allegations of misconduct, and any and all disciplinary actions or proceedings taken against, any law enforcement officer, employee, or representative of the Agency, including, but not limited to \r\n(1) investigative records, \r\n(2) allegations or complaints made, \r\n(3) statements of charge, \r\n(4) transcripts of hearings, \r\n(5) notices of decision, \r\n(6) letters of termination or resignation, \r\n(7) letters of reinstatement, \r\n(8) record of appeal, \r\n(9) final decisions rendered, \r\n(10) records sufficient to show any and all penalties imposed or corrective action taken by the Agency, and \r\n(11) all correspondence, written communications, e-mails, faxes, memorandum and the like pertaining to any such allegations, complaints, or disciplinary proceedings.\r\n\r\nFor a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record,\u201d please see Section 86 of the New York Public Officers Law, which defines a \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record\u201d as \u201cany record created in furtherance of a law enforcement disciplinary proceeding, including, but not limited to: (a) the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee;

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - November 30, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nIf materials are not available for the requested timeframes, please let me know for which periods they are available. We understand that not all recordkeeping systems facilitate convenient access to some materials. \r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-500-7123. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by Gannett Co., Inc., the ultimate parent corporation of the Democrat & Chronicle, and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. \r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

It is our interpretation that matters prior to the date of repeal remain protected as dispositions in such matters may have been entered into on the basis of reliance and understanding that Sec. 50-a of the NYS Civil Rights Act would prevent public disclosure of such information.  Additionally, disclosure of disciplinary matters wherein the subject was exonerated or the allegations/claims were determined unfounded would be protected pursuant to New York Public Officer\u2019s Law \u00a787(2)(b), under which access to records may be denied where disclosure \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-nine of this article.\u201d   The Committee on Open Government has opined that \u201cwhen allegations or charges of misconduct have not yet been determined or did not result in disciplinary action, the records relating to such allegations may\u2026be withheld, for disclosure would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d See, FOIL AO 19775, quoting FOIL AO 17195.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nErik C.

If there is a specific issue or matter regarding AdventHealth/Adventist Health that the requestor is looking for, that could help us narrow our search and limit the cost and the amount of records that would need to be reviewed for confidential and exempt information.\r\n\r\nIf the requestor wishes to narrow the request or has something more specific they are looking for, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nKylie",

First of all, Florida's Office of the Attorney General has been a great help and I sincerely appreciate all of you.\r\n\r\n I am interested in all 290 complaints within the criteria I specified.\r\n\r\nAs far as emails, I separately, I revise the criteria to be from August 29th, 2022 to 2023, the date of the processing of this request. Please let me know if the emails still produce too numerous of results in that timeframe or is overly burdensome. If so, I narrow the criteria further in regards to emails to include only the following individuals that are presently part of AdventHealth (aka Adventist Health System) leadership as either sender, recipient, cc, bcc, or otherwise in the body of the email. These individuals in leadership are: Terry D Shaw (Terry.Shaw@AdventHealth.com) [CEO/President nationwide for AdventHealth], Randy Haffner (Randy.Haffner@AdventHealth.com) [CEO of AdventHealth's Florida Division], Opal Howard (Opal.Howard@AdventHealth.com)[Chief People Officer], Heather Ross (Heather.Ross@AdventHealth.com) [Director of Employee Relations], Jeffrey Bromme (Jeffery.Broome@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Legal Office], and the Paul Rathbun (Paul.Rathbun@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Financial Officer] as well if any email originated from their personal emails, if that is readily known, otherwise that may be disregarded. Additionally, I add an attorney that represents AdventHealth, whose name is Paul Prather (PPrather@littler.com) [Law Firm: Littler].\r\n\r\nThe full leadership page (which may be slightly outdated since some contacts do not apparently have an @AdventHealth.com email address) can be found here: https://www.adventhealth.com/adventhealth-leadership\r\n\r\nIf this still produces too numerous results, you may contact me for additional clarification, and I will further narrow the criteria.\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your following up with us regarding this request.  The DHS regulation requires that requesters describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component\u2019s filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. The regulation also states that to the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, component, or reference number.\r\n\r\nConversely, requests seeking \u201cany records\u201d without regard to a specific topic or keyword generate a great deal of material that is unlikely to be of interest to the public or shed light on the government\u2019s operations but will still need to go through the page-by-page, line-by-line review process.  Processing these kinds of requests do not provide as much value to the public, and hinder our ability to respond to all FOIA requesters in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThus, please provide us with an office or component, names of individuals/targets that you believe have these records, in addition to, keywords or phrases and a specific timeframe to narrow the scope of your search.  Let us know if you have any further questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nThe Privacy Office\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\r\n245 Murray Lane SW\r\nSTOP-0655\r\nWashington, D.C. 20528-0655\r\n'202-343-1743 | '866-431-0486 | 7 202-343-4011\r\n\u2022 foia@hq.dhs.gov<mailto:foia@hq.dhs.gov>\r\n\r\nThis is covered by federal and state law governing electronic communications and may contain confidential and legally privileged information.

We pulled all documents in our system, and 2008 was the oldest year for which we have data available on referenda. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIncluded in each file is the text of the referendum, the local government area, the county, and the election date. We do not have the result of the election in these files though you are welcome to use our Election Results Dashboard to view historical election results, including referenda. The threshold for these to pass is 50%.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nState Board Staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at North Carolina State Board of Elections.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 1360313-0 for FBI records concerning John Francis Good.  The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

Sorry for my not being informed of the name change.\r\n\r\nWith regards to this FOIA on John Good, one main file and two reference serials were located on this subject.  The main file does consist of 5 sections with approximately 1,777 pages covering Mr. Good's career.  If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.  I do appreciate your consideration and patience.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeslie Wilson",

        "communication": "Dear Burkely Hermann:\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\r\nof February 8th, 2024 for records in the custody of the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration related to Alexander Christopher Efthim. Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on February 20, 2024 and assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78541.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to the Department of Justice (Record Group 60) file\r\nnumber 146-1-51-3218 on Alexander Efthim, which was referred to by NARA's\r\nTextual Reference division. My initial assessment is that Alexander\r\nChistopher Efthim is the subject of the records. The file was created\r\nbetween May 1951 and June 1955 and consists of an estimated 40 pages.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we conducted a search of all available indexes of records of\r\nthe FBI (Record Group 65) transferred to the National Archives. I\r\nidentified FBI file number 100-HQ-373735 on Alexander Christopher Efthim,\r\ncompiled as part of a Domestic Security investigation, created between\r\nOctober 1950 and September 1974 and consisting of an estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA: https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue. Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we\r\nestimate it will take 39 months to complete processing.\r\n\r\nBecause the results of your FOIA search request comprise two separate\r\nrecord groups, I was instructed to split them into two separate requests.\r\nThe FBI Index Search relating to Alexander Efthim was assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78720. Please note that though they are assigned\r\ndifferent tracking numbers they will be processed together at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the files at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $112.00.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190. Please include your FOIA\r\ntracking number in all communications concerning this request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request and would like the\r\nopportunity to discuss our response, you may contact our FOIA Public\r\nLiaison for assistance:\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison: Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\ndc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-3190\r\n\r\nIf you have other questions regarding your request, please contact me\r\ndirectly.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcus Bacher\r\nArchivist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5510\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nmarcus.bacher@nara.gov\r\n(301) 837-9215\r\nwww.archives.gov/research/foia/",

I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The last status update was performed on April 16, 2014.\r\n\r\nUpon entering your FOIPA Request Number, the requester will be provided one of the following STATUS RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program is processing your request in accordance to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act guidelines.  *The Disclosure analyst is making a line by line, page by page review of the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.  Upon completion, the records are forwarded to a supervisor for review, if approved, a release will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.   You may be contacted via form letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.  *Requests are received by Initial Processing (IP) where they are opened, assigned a FOIPA Request Number and correspondence mailed to the requester.   The IP analyst searches for, retrieves and reviews potentially responsive records.  If responsive records are located, they are forwarded to Disclosure for processing.\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program has identified potential responsive information to your request(s) and is forwarding this request(s) for assignment to a FOI/PA Legal Administrative Specialist (LAS) for further processing.  *Responsive records are forwarded to the Perfected Backlog where they await assignment to a Disclosure analyst for processing.\r\n\r\nThe information you have requested is part of a previously requested subject matter and will be preprocessed in accordance to the prior releasable information.  *A previous request has already been made for the subject matter.\r\n\r\nThe request is currently in appeal status with the Office of Information Policy (OIP).  *The FBI is not involved in the appeals process so please contact OIP\u2019s Customer Service regarding appeal matters at (202) 514-3642.\r\n\r\nThe request is currently in litigation with Federal Court\r\n\r\nThe FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.  *Correspondence and/or a release of records were recently mailed.

The last status update was performed on May 21, 2014.\r\n\r\nUpon entering your FOIPA Request Number, the requester will be provided one of the following STATUS RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program is processing your request in accordance to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act guidelines.  *The Disclosure analyst is making a line by line, page by page review of the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.  Upon completion, the records are forwarded to a supervisor for review, if approved, a release will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.   You may be contacted via form letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.  *Requests are received by Initial Processing (IP) where they are opened, assigned a FOIPA Request Number and correspondence mailed to the requester.   The IP analyst searches for, retrieves and reviews potentially responsive records.  If responsive records are located, they are forwarded to Disclosure for processing.\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program has identified potential responsive information to your request(s) and is forwarding this request(s) for assignment to a FOI/PA Legal Administrative Specialist (LAS) for further processing.  *Responsive records are forwarded to the Perfected Backlog where they await assignment to a Disclosure analyst for processing.\r\n\r\nThe information you have requested is part of a previously requested subject matter and will be preprocessed in accordance to the prior releasable information.  *A previous request has already been made for the subject matter.\r\n\r\nThe request is currently in appeal status with the Office of Information Policy (OIP).  *The FBI is not involved in the appeals process so please contact OIP\u2019s Customer Service regarding appeal matters at (202) 514-3642.\r\n\r\nThe request is currently in litigation with Federal Court\r\n\r\nThe FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.  *Correspondence and/or a release of records were recently mailed.  If you recently had a change of address please contact us at foiparequest@ic.fbi.gov.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you require further assistance.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n*Material is provided for information purposes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid P.

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Finformation-technology-new-york-14842%252Fair-filtration-and-ventilation-guidance-enforcement-154432%252F%253Femail%253Dnoreply%252540nyc.gov&url_auth_token=AABCUuV-4IYMaBThH4C3bwri3dk%3A1r1I7M%3As746NmxyqA5uebm7VT6APEjGG1lm71f57UVkOfWb3lw \r\n \r\n \r\nRequester's Contact Information \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Name: \r\n Alexander Riccio \r\n \r\n Title: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Organization: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Email: \r\n  154432-69389349@requests.muckrock.com (mailto:154432-69389349@requests.muckrock.com) \r\n \r\n Phone Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Fax Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 1): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 2): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n City: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n State: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Zip Code: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\nYou can view the request and take any necessary action at the following webpage: https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/request/view/FOIL-2023-858-00359.

Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",
