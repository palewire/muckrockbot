See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\nPlease note that the Agency considers the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions to maximize releases to requesters.  Additionally, the Agency's response to your request does not include documents or publications publicly available on our website or compilations of publicly available news articles.\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Amber Smith at (202) 694-1437, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

Any such appeal must be filed in writing and should follow the guidelines set forth in 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.8.  If you have any questions, please contact the FOIA Requester Service Center at FOIA@fec.gov<mailto:FOIA@fec.gov>, or (202) 694-1650.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatrina Sutphin\r\nFOIA/Privacy Counsel",

        "communication": "Dera Ms. Feldman:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your October 24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) request for records related to package theft trends across major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specially, your requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Statistics on reported package thefts from Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Denver and Portland between January 1, 2019, and the present.\r\n  2.  Policies and protocols for investigating package theft involving USPS deliveries.\r\n  3.  Communication or agreements between the USPS Postal Inspection Service and local police departments regarding theft investigations and prevention.\r\n  4.  Public outreach materials or initiatives addressing package theft prevention.\r\n\r\nThe OIG FOIA case number shown in the subject line above has been assigned to your request. Your request will be processed in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides agencies 20 working days from receipt to respond to requesters. While this office routinely meets this requirement, current workloads may require additional time to provide our final response.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA is about records we have in our possession. The FOIA provides only for disclosing federal agency records and does not require government agencies to answer questions, conduct unreasonably burdensome research, or create records. FOIA does not let you appeal any investigative decisions or ask us to research aside from searching for responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, unless such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgment is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and employment/personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the law enforcement, crime prevention, and security arm of USPS, and is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Additional information regarding the USPIS FOIA program can be found at Terms of Service and Legal | USPIS<https://www.uspis.gov/terms-of-service#freedom-of-information-act>.\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG\u2019s mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \u201coversight authority\u201d for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control. Likewise, the OIG Deputy General Counsel has no authority to review FOIA determinations issued by the Postal Service or USPIS.\r\n\r\nBecause records related to external mail theft are maintained by the USPIS, we are forwarding a copy of your request to their FOIA office. They will issue a separate FOIA case number and respond to you directly. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them via email at foia@uspis.gov<mailto:foia@uspis.gov>, or in writing at:\r\n\nOffice of Counsel\r\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service FOIA/PA Unit\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 3301\r\nWashington, DC  20260\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAny and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request such documents produced to include, but not limited to, the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such a production of the documents in question 1 is not possible, please provide any reports, incident notes, status updates, or documents which were submitted to DESE as the result of a school based arrest or any such referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement or arrest, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHeather Atherton\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

If Panola County Sheriff's Department claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. If possible, I prefer that the records be produced in electronic format.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlake Feldman",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Your Freedom of Information Law (\"FOIL\") request, dated June 21, 2024, sought the following records from the Office of the New York City Comptroller:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All reports, summaries, and letters from the January 1-June 30, 2018 audit of the New York City Department of Finance's bail fund management.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request is granted. Your request for \"reports, summaries, and letters\" regarding the referenced June 21, 2019 Letter Report on the Department of Finance's Bail Fund Management is granted. The records are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that internal memoranda created by Comptroller's Office's Bureau of Audit staff summarizing interviews and meetings conducted for this audit report have been withheld. These internal agency records may be permissibly withheld under N.Y.S. POL \u00a7 87(2)(g), which exempts inter- and intra-agency communications that are not (i) statistical or factual tabulations or data; (ii) instructions to staff that affect the public; (iii) final agency policy or determinations; or (iv) external audits.  Although inter-agency materials are \"not defined under the FOIL statute, New York's courts have construed this term to mean deliberative material, i.e., communications exchanged for discussion purposes not constituting final policy decisions.\"  Russo v. Nassau Cty. Cmty. Coll., 81 N.Y.2d 690, 699 (1993); see also Tuck-It-Away Assocs., L.P. v. Empire State Dev. Corp., 54 A.D.3d 154, 166 (App. Div. 1st Dep't 2008) (\"the purpose of the intra-agency exemption [is] to permit people within an agency to exchange opinions, advice and criticism freely and frankly, without the chilling prospect of public disclosure\"); Gould v. New York City Police Department, 89 N.Y.2d 267, 277 (1986) (inter-agency materials are exempt from FOIL production if such materials include \"opinions, ideas, or advice exchanged as part of the consultative or deliberative process of government decision making.\"). Accordingly, portions of the record where Comptroller's Office staff exchanged thoughts, opinions, and non-final drafts internally as part of the deliberative process of government decision-making have been withheld under N.Y.S. POL \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder N.Y.S. Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4), you have the right to appeal. Appeals must be submitted within 30 calendar days of receipt of this response and should be submitted by email to FOIL@comptroller.nyc.gov<mailto:FOIL@comptroller.nyc.gov>. Please put \"FOIL Appeal\" in the email's subject field. Appeals may also be mailed to the following address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIL Appeals Officer\r\n\r\nNew York City Comptroller's Office\r\n\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\n\r\nOne Centre Street, Suite 602\r\n\r\nNew York, NY 10007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your request, please send an email to our FOIL Officer at foil@comptroller.nyc.gov<mailto:foil@comptroller.nyc.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNYC Comptroller's Office FOIL Unit\n",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3.

The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Indian Health Service's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

My request specifically states \"All emails, text messages, chat messages (Teams, Slack, etc), and/or call logs [...]\" in item 1 and \"Any notes, work logs, or other memoranda [...]\" in item 2 specifically regarding public records request PDR_181. While 42.56.080 classifies \"A request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by an agency\" as an invalid request, the statute continues \"a request for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword or name shall not be considered a request for all of an agency's records\". The topic is clearly discernable from my original request: records \"regarding the fulfillment of PDR_181\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you ask for a \"date range\". It would be reasonable to assume that the date range would begin on the date the request was filed (April 14) until the date this request was received, rather than threatening to close my request if no clarification is provided. This is common practice by other municipal agencies I have requested similar records from.\r\n\r\nAs you are familiar with the Washington Public Records Act, it is hard not to wonder whether these are attempts to unreasonably delay my request or otherwise deny me access to the requested records. I again respectfully ask that I be provided with the full breadth of the requested information without unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPlease save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds if you just send me the .csv file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent, received, or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2007 to present day to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

As I read it Section 3-4.2 of the manual describes the circumstances under which mutual aid can be requested / accepted, and the rules for doing so. \r\n\r\nBut my request sought a record reflecting the process described in this manual actually happening: \r\n\r\n\u201cA copy of any Memorandum of Understanding, Memorandum of Agreement, Mutual Aid Agreement, or other, similar document allowing the Atlanta Police Department to exercise police power outside the City of Atlanta's territorial jurisdiction in unincorporated Dekalb County.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo narrow a bit, let\u2019s focus on the property surrounding Key Road, Constitution, and Bouldercrest, where APD is currently exercising police power. Is there a memo of understanding for that exercise between DKPD and APD? If so, that\u2019s what I thought I was requesting. Happy to file a new request and close this one out if it\u2019s easier, but it also seems like a list of standing agreements reflecting the decisions laid out in 3-4.2 is a record DKPS would have that would be responsive to my original request. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAndrew Free\r\n                ",

NASA has previously released such lists of media collaborations for other years, including to this requester, who has made them public.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
