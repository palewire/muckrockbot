        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front (NWLF). The NWLF was a radical left-wing terrorist group that formed on or around November 23, 1973, with the bombing of a Pacific Gas and Electric utility substation in Cupertino, California. Over the next six years, the NWLF was credited with bombings throughout the United States; one instance, in 1976, involved members of the organization placing an explosive device on a windowsill at the home of then-San Francisco Supervisor (and later United States Senator) Dianne Feinstein. NWLF membership overlapped with another organization the FBI monitored in this same period: the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). SLA members Bill and Emily Harris claimed membership in the NWLF at the time of their arrests, in 1975.\r\n\r\nThe FBI, at various points during the 1970s, identified the NWLF as a subject of interest in ongoing investigations. Page six of a memorandum located in the FBI's HEARNAP records (dated October 11, 1974; HEARNAP Part 21, page 41) contains what appears to be a Bureau file number for the NWLF at its Los Angeles Field Office: \"LOS ANGELES IS CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE CASE CAPTIONED 'UNSUB; BOMBING OF SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL, 9750 AIRPORT BOULEVARD, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 5, 1974' EID - NEW WORLD LIBERATION FRONT, 00: LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES FILE 174-2103.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a September 7, 1978 bulletin created by the FBI Terrorism Research Center outlined a detailed history and methodology of the NWLF, stating, in part: \"[I]ncidents, over 70,  have ... occurred in Seattle, Washington; Rainier, Oregon; and Aurora, Colorado. Victims of NWLF attacks have included Federal, state and local governmental functions, diplomatic establishments, corporate facilities, and public utilities. Communiques claiming responsibility for the incidents state the actions were staged to protest against governmental policies and the intervention of the U.S. corporations into the internal affairs of foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nBoth items indicate that the FBI created HQ and field office files for the NWLF in the course of investigations into terrorist attacks carried out by the organization. Therefore, I am requesting copies of all FBI records, documents, and communications responsive to the New World Liberation Front, aka the NWLF.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of investigations into left-wing terrorism. The FBI has already made public records related to the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in its HEARNAP collection. Contained in these records are numerous references to then NWLF, yet the FBI has not released any records on this group. Contemporaneous and postmortem accounts of the NWLF identify that Ms. Hearst interacted with NWLF members before her capture, thus the release of all NWLF records would contribute significantly to public understanding of the FBI's handling of the HEARNAP case.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the NWLF carried out attacks on public officials and public services for almost a decade. Understanding how the FBI responded to these attacks is a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

You can reduce costs by decreasing the number of emails collected. For example, you could narrow the time frame of your search, limit which employee's email accounts are searched, or add additional limiting search terms to reduce the scope of your request. \r\nIf you are interested in working with me on refining your request to get you the information you seek, at a lower cost to you, please let me know. \r\nPlease respond back within 10 business days, if we do not hear back we will create an estimate for the full search. \r\nPlease note that you will need to disable your pop-up blocker in your browser settings in order to make an online payment. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nReid Kakesako \r\nPortland Police Bureau - Public Records (He/Him) 503-823-0756 \r\nIf you are having technical\u00a0difficulties with the website, please contact the website administrator by phone or email. \u00a0(503) 823-6040 or prrhelp@portlandoregon.gov",
