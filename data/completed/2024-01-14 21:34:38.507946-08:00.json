        "communication": "Dear Mr. Feathers, In response to your public records request, and in addition to the response provided to you on Friday, July 7, 2023, please find our explanations, legal analysis and notes.  Separately, you will receive a Dropbox email with responsive records.  For clarity's sake, I include your requests and our replies.\r\n1)      All instruction manuals, handbooks, and policies provided to department employees regarding the use of the department's machine learning unemployment benefits fraud detection system (As described here: https://www.10tv.com/article/news/investigations/10-investigates/after-paying-out-228-million-in-fraudulent-unemployment-claims-ohio-turns-to-google-others-for-help/530-64ff75b4-a9ef-4a4b-afca-9dbb60036890<https://www.10tv.com/article/news/investigations/10-investigates/after-paying-out-228-million-in-fraudulent-unemployment-claims-ohio-turns-to-google-others-for-help/530-64ff75b4-a9ef-4a4b-afca-9dbb60036890> and here https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/projects/jfs+fighting+covid+fraud<https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/projects/jfs+fighting+covid+fraud>).\r\n\r\n      No manuals or training materials were created for the fraud dashboard. Likewise, no training manuals were created for the Google dashboard. We will be producing, by Dropbox, training materials provided to staff on Experian and Lexis Nexus ID Proofing. There is a single training video that we are reviewing to ensure it contains no Confidential Personal Information, which is exempted from production as a public record.  Once that review is completed, I will be in touch.\r\n2)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims the system flagged as having at least one indicator of fraud each week since the department's machine learning unemployment benefits fraud detection system was launched.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS has and will provide via Dropbox responsive records as of January 1, 2022, but we do not possess requested records prior to that date, and we are not required to create new records to satisfy this request. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 707 N.E.2d 496 (1999).\r\n3)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were submitted, approved, and denied in each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      Although we already provided resources to you regarding this request in our email of July 7, 2023, we respond here with our legal analysis of the same. You asked for documentation regarding which unemployment benefit claims were \"approved, and denied in each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\"  To our knowledge the links that we provided do not show approvals or denials. ODJFS also does not have other public records that provide that level of detail.  As noted above, ODJFS is not required to create a public record to satisfy this this request. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 707 N.E.2d 496 (1999).\r\n4)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were investigated for potential fraud in each week since Jan 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS does not possess a record that is responsive to this request and is not required to generate such a request.  State ex rel. Kerner v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 1998-Ohio-242, 695 N.E.2d 256 (holding that an agency is not required to reprogram computers to comply with a public records request).  We note that some of the requested detail can be found at the ETA website that tracks determination information, Data Downloads (doleta.gov)<https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDownloads.asp>. It is in ETA 227, Section B (Number of Cases Investigated).\r\n5)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were confirmed as fraudulent after investigation each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS does not possess a record that is responsive to this request and is not required to generate such a request.  State ex rel. Kerner v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 1998-Ohio-242, 695 N.E.2d 256 (holding that an agency is not required to reprogram computers to comply with a public records request).  We note that the ETA 227 report would provide the number of fraud overpayments established by quarter for Regular UI, and there are separate ETA 227 reports for PEUC, MEUC, and FPUC.  Similarly, the ETA 902 report would provide the number of fraud overpayments established by month for PUA.  As with the ETA 227, there is a separate ETA 902 report for FPUC which includes PUA and FPUC data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole S.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B2 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your agency provided substantially similar data in 2022. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "This is an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2021, I requested documents under the Freedom of Information Act. On March 22, 2021, ICE assigned request number 2021-ICFO-32190 to this request and invoked a 10-day extension pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). Although ICE released some of the records requested on November 4, 2021, it has yet to issue a determination regarding this request as it failed to determine and communicate the scope of the documents it intends to produce and withhold, and the reasons for withholding any documents and to inform AOL that it can appeal any adverse part of the determination. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, to the extent that this is a final disclosure under FOIA, we appeal numerous redactions made by the agency pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7. FOIA's exemptions are \u201cexplicitly made exclusive and must be narrowly construed.\u201d Milner v. Dep't of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011). FOIA Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold information about individuals in \"personnel and medical files and similar files\" when the disclosure \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). FOIA Exemption 7(C) allows agencies to withhold personal information compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). An agency must weigh the public interests for and private interests against disclosure rather than redacting all names across the board. See Am. Immigr. Laws. Ass'n v. Exec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., 830 F.3d 667, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2016). ICE redacted almost every name in their releases without any balancing of interests. As such, ICE improperly redacted information pursuant Exemptions 6 and 7(C). \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) allows the government to withhold law enforcement information that \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). Much of the information redacted by ICE pursuant to Exemption 7(E) cannot conceivably be related to law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or raise a reasonable risk of circumvention of law. As such, ICE violated Exemption 7(E).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about handling this appeal, you reach us at jeremy@alotrolado.org\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAl Otro Lado",

I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

As such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in this section may be extended, by written notice by the head of the agency, or his or her designee, to the person making the request, setting for the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than 14 days. Per section 7922.000., certain records of a personal nature which may be part of an application shall not be disclosed where the City has determined that the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure.\r\nThere is no charge for electronic copies. If hardcopies are requested, you will be notified in advance of the cost.  Please refer to the City\u2019s Fee Schedule for records related costs. Please be advised that the fees listed are subject to change.\r\nIf your request pertains to Building Records, you can search for records that may be responsive to your request at the Public Records Portal.\r\nFor any additional information or questions related to this request, please contact the Burbank City Clerk\u2019s Office at cityclerks@burbankca.gov<mailto:cityclerks@burbankca.gov>.\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA3D63.EE7347C0]\r\nMARIA SANCHEZ\r\nInterim Municipal Records Clerk\r\n(818) 238-5851\r\n275 E.
