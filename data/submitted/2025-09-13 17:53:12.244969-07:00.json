        "communication": "Hi, Grey:\r\nThank you for your email.\r\n\r\nClarification is needed before we can begin searching for records. Indiana\u2019s public records law (APRA) requires a request for public records to be made with \u201creasonable particularity,\u201d which is necessary for an agency to locate and disclose records responsive to a request accurately and efficiently. See Ind. Code \u00a7 5-14-3-3(a). Indiana\u2019s Public Access Counselor has written many advisory opinions on what \u201creasonable particularity\u201d means; for example, the Public Access Counselor advises that requests for emails include a specifically named sender and recipient, a date range of less than six months, and search terms. See Advisory Opinion of the Public Access Counselor 16-FC-128.\r\n\r\nTo enable us to conduct a search, please narrow your request as outlined below.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health is not denying your request, but is instead asking that you amend your request to satisfy the legal requirements of APRA. After receipt of such an amended request, responsive records will be identified and gathered. It may be that some records will be produced subject to redaction and other documents may be withheld as permitted by applicable law. Pursuant to Indiana Code \u00a7 5-14-3-3, disclosable records will be provided in a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenise Derrer Spears\r\nPublic Information Director\r\nIndiana State Board of Animal Health   www.in.gov/boah<http://www.in.gov/boah>\r\nIndiana Board of Veterinary Medicine   www.in.gov/VetBoard<http://www.in.gov/VetBoard>\r\nOffice:  317-544-2414\r\nMobile:  317-501-7583\r\n\r\n*We'd love your feedback.
