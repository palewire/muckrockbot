        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Welsh,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you regarding the scope of your request. I have completed my review of DOI-OS-2023-001109. The responsive records consist of excel documents, some of which contain columns of PII (personally identifiable information). Because the PII columns contain some names and email addresses belonging to law enforcement officials, they must be redacted and sent to the Solicitor's office for further review, which could significantly increase the wait time for these records.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are amenable to excluding the columns with PII from the responsive records, we could then release them to you immediately. The make, model, year, and identifiers of each drone would still be available in the responsive records. Would you be willing to exclude the columns of PII? Please let me know at your convenience so that I can move to either release the records (should you agree to remove columns with PII) or send the records for further review (if you wish to keep the columns with PII).\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D92BE6.FABDDE80]\r\nTim Turner\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nU.S. Department of the Interior\r\nOffice of the Secretary",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

So we can begin processing, please confirm for us what your requester category is - i.e., whether you are a commercial requester, news media, or individual.\r\n\r\nNote:  There are three categories of requesters: 1) Commercial; 2) educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news media; and 3) all other requesters, including members of the general public.  The requester category bears on the amount of fees that might be assessed in processing your request.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of each requester category, and information on what fees (i.e., for search, review, and duplication) would be charged depending on the requester category can be found in our revised fee regulations found here:  https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f97c375521e692fad78c1a5f62893518&mc=true&node=se16.2.1015_19&rgn=div8\r\n\r\nPlease reply directly to me via email confirming your requester category, and provide sufficient information supporting your identification of the applicable requester category.

        "communication": "June 03, 2021 RE:\u00a0 USAID FOIA No. F-00189-21 (FOIA Specialist Assignment Email) Dear Mr. Boguslaw: This acknowledges receipt of your\u00a0June 02, 2021, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\u00a0to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \u00a0Specifically, you requested records concerning the last 200 pages of emails sent to, from, or copied to Samantha Power. You also requested a fee waiver. \r\nFee Waiver \r\nThe FOIA provides that fees should be waived or reduced if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u00a0 As a member of the media, the only applicable fee is duplication.\u00a0 Duplication is $0.10 per page, but the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 After review of the fee waiver criteria, your fee waiver request is moot.\u00a0 Since the only applicable fee is duplication, and USAID routinely furnishes responsive records to FOIA requesters in electronic format, it's most likely there will be no duplication fees to assess. \r\nFOIA Specialist \r\nYour request has been assigned to Theresa Morris, Senior FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Theresa Morris\u00a0by email at thmorris@usaid.gov or by phone on 202-921-5003. \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. \r\nExtending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.

I'm not in need of the individual documents associated with these corrections, just the penalty data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am emailing today to request a correction related to published documents on this MuckRack database site in reference to Medical Facility Enforcement Actions from the Department of Health and Social Services:   https://www.muckrock.com/foi/delaware-236/medical-facility-enforcement-actions-144993/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe published file, titled \"FOIA Request CMP's Imposed\" contains inaccurate information. DHSS regretfully provided incorrect information in response to the FOIA request that led to the publication of a excel file listing facilities fined by the Delaware Division of Health Care Quality.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. McCall,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request (23-11470)\r\nregarding any and all photos of the Surveyor 5 lunar lander. Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.

Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.  Your appeal should be received within ninety (90)\r\ncalendar days from the date of this letter and it should explain why you\r\nbelieve this response does not meet the requirements of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act.  Please address it to the Deputy Archivist of the United\r\nStates (ND), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, Maryland 20740.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of file 62-116931\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P042984-081523.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Amory Houghton Jr.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, the District estimates that it may be able to provide you with documents responsive to your request within ninety (90) business days (June 8, 2023).\r\n\r\nThe district will locate and assemble the information requested, notify third persons or agencies affected by the request if applicable, and/or to determine whether any of the information contained in such documents is exempt from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nIf additional clarification is needed, we will respond as quickly as questions arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n****This is a massive request. I will need time to review the records and provide a cost estimate.\r\nEven once I provide the cost estimate, and you pay the deposit, this request will take a significant amount of time to produce as all records will have to be reviewed and redacted. When I provide the cost estimate I will also provide an updated time estimate.  This request will require multiple installments.  I will provide a cost and updated time estimate by February 17, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the procedure and costs associated with Public Records click Board Policy 4040P<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q0g-_-8x8bM__8Wuj8NkR1x7R5XMUMDU> . Below is a brief summary of potential fees:\r\n\r\n  *   Photocopies or printed copies .15 cents per page\r\n  *   Electronic records .10 cents per page for records scanned to an electronic format\r\n  *   Five cents per every 4 electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery\r\n  *   Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically\r\n  *   Actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n  *   The District may charge a flat fee of up to two dollars for any request as an alternative to fees when the agency reasonably estimates and documents that the cost allowed under this subsection are clearly equal to or more than two dollars.\r\n  *   A customized service charge may be imposed if the District estimates that the request would require the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or to provide customized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the District for other District purposes. The customized service charge may reimburse the District up to the actual cost of providing the services.\r\n  *   The District may choose to not calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if doing so would be unduly burdensome.\r\n  *   The District may waive any charge assess for a request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges before fulfilling the request. The requestor will be allowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges. A deposit of up to ten percent of the estimated costs may be required before processing the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above timeframes are simply estimates and processing your request may take longer than predicted.

Your email asked about the status of the response documents and noted that I had told you that the job would be completed by March 9, 2023. That is not correct.\r\n\r\n  *   My initial completion estimate was June 8, 2023.\r\n  *   I provided a cost estimate on February 16, 2023. That cost estimate included four (4) important notes that would have changed your fee. I did not hear back from you.\r\n  *   I replied to your email on February 17, 2023, asking for an update and I referred you to the fee estimate sent the previous day, which was included in your email string. I also asked you to take careful consideration with the notes regarding the types of requests that are included in this request. I stated you might want to revise your request.\r\n  *   The March 9, 2023, date you are referring to was the first deadline for payment.\r\n  *   On March 10, 2023, I send the 2nd notice of fee notification and included details about the 70 requesters that all received the same documents, and the many requests from MuckRock that you have already received. I received no response from you.\r\n  *   On March 23, 2023, we received the payment of the full $14.46.\r\n\r\nSince you have not communicated with me, I will assume that you want all materials, including all the previously provided MuckRock requests, and the many, many duplicated response documents.\r\n\r\nThe District is still able to provide the response documents by the originally quoted time estimate of June 8, 2023. However, I am busy working on the three other MuckRock requests that require significant, time-intensive redacting. I will work on this request as promptly as I can.\r\n\r\nI anticipate sending these materials to you in multiple installments.  If an extension is needed to our originally quoted time estimate, you will get additional notification and communication.\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.\r\n\r\nThe first installment will be provided by Tuesday, April 25, 2023.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLisa Connors\r\nPublic Records and Compliance Coordinator\r\nAuburn School District\r\n\r\nD: 253-887-3955\r\nP: 253-931-4900\r\nE: lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu<mailto:lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu>\r\n915 4th Street NE, Auburn, WA 98002\r\nwww.auburn.wednet.edu<http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/>",

I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days.

I thought it would be easier to view in smaller chunks of files.\r\n\r\nThe remaining public records request that will be provided are all parent/student records and will need to be reviewed and redacted. I am not able to provide all documents by the originally estimated date of June 8, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new completion estimate is now September 20, 2023. I will do my best to complete this request as quickly as possible. I anticipate at least 2-3 installments remain.\r\n\r\nThe next installment will be provided by June 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\r\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have trouble or if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\nAt any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know. I will provide an update or the next installment on or before June 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLisa Connors\r\nPublic Records and Compliance Coordinator\r\nAuburn School District\r\n\r\nD: 253-887-3955\r\nP: 253-931-4900\r\nE: lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu<mailto:lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu>\r\n915 4th Street NE, Auburn, WA 98002\r\nwww.auburn.wednet.edu<http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/>",

This request has been temporarily placed on hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs written, the request is too broad and would be unduly burdensome on the agency to process. \"[A]n agency need not respond to a request that is so broad as to impose an unreasonable burden upon the agency, such as one which requires the agency to locate, review, redact, and arrange for inspection a vast quantity of material.\" See Serv. Women's Action Network v. Dep't of Def., 888 F. Supp. 2d 282, 290 (D. Conn. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Halpern v.

To avoid the closing of your FOIA request, we ask that you please respond to this message within 10 days. Please note, the closing of your request will not prohibit you from submitting requests in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss, please respond to this message when proposed date and times for next week.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhat are you talking about? \r\n\r\nI am requesting THESE RECORDS:\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 2022\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2020) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2020\r\n\r\nVia email: dcrawford@osd.wednet.edu\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2020 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n",
