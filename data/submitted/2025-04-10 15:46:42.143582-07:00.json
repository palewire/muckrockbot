I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI did not see any of these reports on the following website:  https://utsports.com/sports/2019/8/7/financial.aspx\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
