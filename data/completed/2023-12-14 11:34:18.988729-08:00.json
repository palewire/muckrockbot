        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

Specifically, you requested the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  \"Amount invested into new Faregate equipment installation since May 2021.\r\n  2.  Number of new Faregate installations since they have moved to the new model in Summer 2021\r\n  3.  Number of broken faregates in May 2021.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that WMATA is an interstate compact agency created by the Commonwealth of Virginia, State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia, and not a federal agency.  See Pub. L. No. 89-774, 80 Stat. 1324 (1966); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 33.2-3100; Md. Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 10-204; D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-1107.1). Accordingly, WMATA is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore, your request will be processed pursuant to WMATA's PARP.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarification Required for Your Request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that Part 2 of your request does not specify the timeframe for \"Summer 2021.\" PARP \u00a7 7.5 requires requesters to \"describe the records that are being requested in sufficient detail to enable WMATA to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.\"  Please provide a specific timeframe by close of business, Monday, January 30, 2023, or Part 2 of your request will be closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not yet able to provide any responsive records, we can impart the following general information regarding your request:\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Period for Processing Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWMATA generally aims to respond to a request for records within 20 business days following receipt of the request.  WMATA processes requests in the order that requests are received.  Furthermore, additional processing time is required for requests that prove to be complex, as is the case here.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that your request may include records submitted to WMATA by a third party, which requires us to contact the third party to identify confidential and proprietary information.  WMATA will not release any records until it has had the opportunity to consult with the third party and received appropriate feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExemptions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PARP provides exemptions for certain types of data, including: (1) information that could compromise WMATA infrastructure or security; (2) information that is solely related to the internal personnel rules and practices; (3) information that is exempt by statute; (4) proprietary commercial or financial information; (5) intra-agency and inter-agency memoranda information which would not be made available by law to a party in litigation with WMATA; (6) information that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (7) certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes; (8) registered SmarTrip\u00ae information; and (9) customer financial information.  Generally, WMATA's response will not include any exempt information.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nThe PARP also provides for the assessment of fees associated with a request that requires more than two hours of staff time to process.  These fees are calculated at the employees' basic rate of pay, plus an additional 50 percent to cover benefits, for the time spent responding to a request.  In general, a request is considered an agreement to pay all applicable fees.  Advance payment is required where the fees are likely to exceed $250.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence. If you have any questions, please contact Benjamin Rashbaum at brashbaum@wmata.com<mailto:brashbaum@wmata.com> or 202-962-1926.\r\n\r\n[1] The PARP can be found on WMATA's website at https://www.wmata.com/about/records/public-records.cfm<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmata.com%2Fabout%2Frecords%2Fpublic-records.cfm&data=05%7C01%7CRDNoh%40wmata.com%7Cf106629fcf374d6e6ed608daf24f081e%7Cad5836f40d7443cd83c57e69eaa67915%7C0%7C0%7C638088718496927242%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7C%2BADG97KkMvytD992a3%2FXhdZpQHgRu6MMLRflyTseI%3D&reserved=0>, under the section marked \"Legal Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Ferrari\r\n--\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01D92739.17EEB7C0]\r\nMichael B.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to FBI system FBI-003\t- Bureau Mailing Lists, which is described on the Department of Justice's website at https://www.justice.gov/opcl/doj-systems-records#FBI\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nThe FBI has received your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request and it will be forwarded to Initial Processing for review.   Your request will be processed under the provisions of FOIPA and a response will be mailed to you at a later date.\r\n\r\nRequests for fee waivers and expedited processing will be addressed once your request has been assigned an FOIPA request number. You will receive written notification of the FBI\u2019s decision.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised, beginning Wednesday, March 1, 2017, you will no longer be able to submit FOIPA requests via email.  On this date, FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov> will permanently be taken offline and requests will need to be submitted using the FBI\u2019s electronic FOIPA portal at https://efoia.fbi.gov, after development and testing for two years. With this full implementation, eFOIPA will provide the FBI with an automated process for the receipt and opening of requests, replacing the current manual process and substantially reducing the time it takes to receive and open each electronic request received.  Given the FBI's high volume of requests, this will significantly increase efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms of service for the site will be modified to allow the uploading of attachments, to remove the limitation on the number of requests received each day by the application, to remove limitation on the number of requests which may be submitted by an individual per day, and increase availability to seven days a week-24 hours a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eFOIPA system will allow requests of all types \u2013 e.g.; Privacy Act, deceased individuals, policies/procedures, events, organizations, etc.  Requesters will:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022    Receive digital confirmation directly on their email account.\r\n\r\n\u2022    No longer have to wait for responses to be received using standard mail.\r\n\r\n\u2022    View transmitted responses and releases from the convenience of their smart phone or tablet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s eFOIPA portal was designed and developed to be the FBI\u2019s primary means for receiving FOIA and Privacy Act requests.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions about preparing or submitting your request using this new service, you may email foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov> or contact the Public Information Officer directly at 540-868-4593.  Alternatively, you may submit your request using fax or standard mail.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding the FOIPA is available at http://www.fbi.gov<http://www.fbi.gov>/ or http://www.fbi.gov/foia/<http://www.fbi.goiv/foia/>.  If you require additional assistance please contact the Public Information Officer.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeanna Ramsey\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nPLEASE REPLY DIRECTLY TO FOIPAREQUEST@IC.FBI.GOV\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing. If you chose to narrow the scope of your request, you will be able to request remaining material via a new FOIPA request submission at the completion of this request, subject to applicable fees.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9056A.3F022E00][cid:image002.png@01D9056A.3F022E00]\n",

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following.\r\n\r\nYour request is being preprocessed to another open request on the same subject, meaning a request on the same subject had been received and was already in process prior to receipt of your request.  To avoid duplicative efforts, you will receive the same releases at the same time as the original requester for this subject.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Interim releases are generally made for complex requests.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to reduce the scope of your request; this will accelerate the process and could potentially place your request in a quicker processing queue.  This may also allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  The FBI uses a multi-track processing system to fairly assign and process new requests.  Simple track cases (50 pages or less) usually require the least time to process.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is considered a complex case in our large track.  Please advise us in writing if you would like to discuss reducing the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.\n",

Gotbaum (September 5, 1921 - April 5, 2015). Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/nyregion/victor-gotbaum-labor-leader-who-helped-save-new-york-from-bankruptcy-dies-at-93.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Galante\n\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Mr. William Weyland Turner, aka William W. Turner, aka William Turner, aka Bill Turner (April 14, 1927 \u2013 December 26, 2015). Mr. Turner worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1951 and 1961, and wrote about his time as an agent in a number of non-fiction books, including \"Hoover's FBI\", and as an editor for Ramparts Magazine (100-HQ-445393). In the introduction to \"Hoover's FBI\", Mr. Turner states that the Bureau maintained a case file on him which he obtained in the late 1970s, circa 1978; from pages xvii and xviii of the 1993 edition of the book (ISBN-13: 9781560250630): \"When I obtained my FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) a decade later, the FBI's back-door collaboration with Joe Pyne was confirmed. Several days before the show, Pyne's producer had called the local FBI office soliciting 'any information on Turner' because there were 'some derogatory comments concerning the FBI' in the book. The Special Agent in Charge (SAC) immediately sent an 'Urgent' teletype to Washington headquarters urging that Pyne be furnished an abstract of my dossier. If this wasn't done, the SAC warned, 'IT MAY WRONGLY APPEAR THAT TURNER AND HIS ILK ARE PARAGONS OF TRUTH, VERACITY AND COMPETENCY TO JUDGE.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Turner's privacy, as he passed away on December 26, 2015. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Turner's obituary in The Mercury News, out of San Jose, California. For clarity's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/01/06/william-turner-bay-area-fbi-agent-who-criticized-j-edgar-hoover-dies-at-88/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Turner publicly disclosed his work with the the Bureau in this memoir and in articles for publications like Ramparts Magazine and The Nation, removing any further concerns over privacy. That he wrote extensively about his time as an agent with the Bureau would make him a figure of public interest.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Philly Voice, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to Bureau policies on monitoring former agents. Mr. Turner engaged in a very public dispute with then-director J. Edgar Hoover after his termination in 1961, and given that Mr. Turner himself identified a Bureau file or files showing Bureau surveillance, it would be in the public interest for any Bureau files germane to Mr. Turner to be made public so that this era in the Bureau's history can be better understood and contextualized.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

This letter also stated that I must send a follow-up request for additional records.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as of the date of this correspondence, on September 7, 2023, I am requesting additional records related to request number 1596602-000, for Mr. William Weyland Turner.\r\n\r\nPlease renew my initial request for a fee waiver.

        "communication": "To Whom It Concerns:\r\n\r\nThe District has received your request dated November 4, 2021 at 11:11pm for public record requests received from January 1, 2010- November 4, 2021 and responses to these requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to process your request, we find clarification is necessary. Please clarify if you are seeking records released in response to these requests, or just the communication responding to the request, without the records that were provided in response to the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis clarification is necessary because, as a school district,  many of our requests are made by parents or legal representatives of students requesting email records that discuss students and students\u2019 education.  Student records are protected under RCW 42.56.230 and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  Redacting these records in order to release them to you will take a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for public record requests made by staff members for records, which would be released largely unredacted to the staff member but would require considerable redactions prior to releasing them to anyone else.  Our Collective Bargaining Agreements also require notification require prior to releasing records that discuss staff, even in a redacted state. We would like to provide the records you are seeking as quickly and efficiently as possible but would like to avoid additional time-intensive work if you are not seeking those records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our office follows the record retention schedules established by the Washington Secretary of State, we will not be able to provide records dating back to 2010. We will work with our technology staff to retrieve electronic records dating back to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act, chapter 42.56 RCW, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested.  Given the nature of the request, that is the case here.  The District anticipates being able to release records on or before January 4, 2022.  The sooner you respond to our request for clarification, the sooner we will be able to begin work on your request.  Please let us know if you are no longer seeking records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for the records is $2.00.  The disc may be picked up at the cashier's desk on the second floor of the Administration building - at which time the disc will be release to you.  Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.70, which includes the cost of the envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.

If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.

For example, records which were previously provided to parents or employees that contain exempt information would need additional review and redaction prior to releasing these records to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease clarify within 30 days whether you are, in fact, seeking those records which will require additional review and redaction. If we do not receive clarification from you within 30 days, we will assume you are not seeking those records which require additional redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.21 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before December 22, 2022. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>\r\n\r\n\r\n\"...Just Keep Moving.\" -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.",

Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201, Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease also note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before July 14, 2023, due to the records needing additional review, redactions and/or third party notification prior to releasing the records to your organization.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, it has come to our attention today that you updated your mailing address and informed us of your new address via U.S. Mail instead of responding to my email.  We now understand why our past installments were being sent back to us \"return to sender\".  In the future, please direct any communications regarding your request either directly to me, or to District representative Terri LeFors.  I have included Terri on this communication to ensure you have her email address moving forward.  If you do feel the need to continue to send communications regarding your public records request via U.S. Mail, please ensure that any mailings contain language directing the email directly to Terri (i.e., \"attn: Terri LeFors\") rather than the District in general.\r\n\r\nYour past communication went to the District's billing department, who does not handle the processing of public records requests.  Thus, any communications you send to the District in general (or to the billing department specifically) may not be received by the District's public records department.  In the meantime, we will resend your previous installments to you at your newly-provided address.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, we believe it may take us a few more days than originally anticipated to provide you with the next installment.  We now estimate being able to provide you with that installment on or before October 13, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex Fern\r\nAssociate Attorney\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D9EF9A.19E04330]\r\n510 W.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 72-HQ-2190.  The FBI located approximately 1,374 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 57 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\n",

The original email goes into more detail for our contact with you.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nFrom: FBI.FOIPA.NEGOTIATION\r\nSent: Monday, August 3, 2020 10:58 AM\r\nTo: 91016-87663711@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:91016-87663711@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nSubject: FOIPA # 1463943-000\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 74-WF-293.  The FBI located approximately 1,100 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 8 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 29 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 56 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5.

I ran a preliminary search of ALJ Westby's mailbox with your criteria and the search has resulted in 10,808 emails. These results cannot be provided in .pst format as I must open and export them to review for confidentiality. I will open the emails as .msg files and provide what I can in that format. Any emails that have confidential information that must be redacted will be provided in .pdf format accompanied by an exemption log explaining each redaction. You wish to not receive records through this (GovQA) system, that is fine, but we do not upload documents to external sites. I can provide the responsive records via email, but our emails are limited to 31Mb so anything over that size will not be able to be sent via email. Would you like large files to be sent to your physical address on a cd? If all of the above is correct, I will begin reviewing the emails for confidentiality and will provide you the responsive records in installments until complete. If you would like to narrow your search or provide search terms, I can rerun the search and go from there. If I do not hear from you, I will proceed processing the request with no changes - I just need to know how you would like to receive the large files. Your first installment of records will be provided to you on November 29, 2022 . Please let me know if I missed anything or have misinterpreted your request in any way. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at (360) 463-9006 or PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov (mailto:PublicRecords@oah.wa.gov) \r\nSincerely, Tiffany Scoggin Information Governance Officer Public Records Officer",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nNorth Thurston Public Schools (\u201cDistrict\u201d) received your public records request on November 5, 2021. Your request seeks all public records requests received by the District from January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021, as well as a complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s responses to those requests.\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201celectronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE format for each record.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests since 2010 have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf. And as noted earlier, you have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question, and such responses typically did not contain native format records. In light of this conflict, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\n\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses.\r\n\r\nPer RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120 authorize the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the District estimates that it will be able to disclose an initial installment of records by February 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions at this time.\r\n\nLisa Spector\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n\r\nNorth Thurston Public Schools\r\n305 College Street NE\r\nLacey, WA  98516\r\n360-412-4418\r\npublicrecords@nthurston.k12.wa.us",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRobert Hammond \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/perseverance2013/109058/NARA_22-V.B.MUCK._NARA_FOIA_Request_and_Appeals_Logs_FY_21.pdf \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnational-archives-and-records-administration-129%252Fexpedited-foia-request-nara-22-vamuck-nara-foia-request-and-appeals-case-processing-logs-fy-17-129453%252F%253Femail%253Dfoia%252540nara.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj2tdGHKX1-c-t6oDvxXcze3A%3A1nwFU8%3AYLbZ2LAmpSQMyTXzCBTCUV3EPMT76A1DzW8TPC9n0Cw",

'garym.stern@nara.gov'\r\n\r\nNARA falsely states on November 30, 2023 that \"A final decision letter regarding NGC22-572 was sent to you on May 24, 2023.\" There is no such final decision letter in Muckrock.com, which is where NARA is mandated to send such decision letter, thereby placing records into the public domain.\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking via Muckrock.com:\r\n\r\n1. NARA\u2019s FY 2017 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA Processing Logs.\r\na. The FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No. 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states:\r\n\r\nWe recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text searching of FOIA logs.\r\nTo be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of the following fields in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\na) Tracking number of the request.\r\nb) Date of the request.\r\nc) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters; the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\nd) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request.\r\ne) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\nf) Subject matter of the request.\r\ng) Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.).\r\nh) For requests that have been closed, the date closed and the result of the FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni) Fee Information\r\na. Fee category assigned to requester, if applicable (commercial, educational, news\r\nmedia, other).\r\nb. Whether a fee waiver was requested.\r\nc. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted.\r\nd. Amount of fees charged.\r\ne. Amount of fees paid.\r\n2. I will accept the Logs with their current data. Apart from the FOIA Advisory Committee recommendation that agencies should proactively post their FOIA logs, the logs exist in any event and are subject to prompt release under the FOIA.\r\n3. I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n4. See PDF for complete FOIA Reqeust. See Requested Format.\r\n5. Although I am seeking expedited processing and prompt release of all records, I am seeking a rolling release of those records that are immediately available followed by a list of additional searches and estimated completion dates for them.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nI am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com.\r\n\r\nI am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format.\r\nI am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable in the application by the general Public. The release type must be set to \u201cUnredacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public,\u201d or to \u201cRedacted \u2013 Releasable to the General Public: Will be available to the general public.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other.

NARA\u2019s FY 2017 FOIA Operational Records FOIA Requests and Appeals FOIA\r\n> Processing Logs.\r\n> a. The FOIA Advisory Committee, approved Tech Committee Recommendation No.\r\n> 2022-TS3 (Part 2) \u201cPosting FOIA Logs\u201d states:\r\n>\r\n> We recommend that agencies proactively publish FOIA logs in the agency\u2019s\r\n> electronic reading room (often referred to as FOIA Libraries) on an ongoing\r\n> basis, at least quarterly. Agencies should allow for the full text\r\n> searching of FOIA logs.\r\n> To be most useful, agency FOIA logs should contain, at a minimum, each of\r\n> the following fields in either Excel or CSV format, in preference to PDF:\r\n> a) Tracking number of the request.\r\n> b) Date of the request.\r\n> c) Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester\r\n> (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \u2013 to be most\r\n> useful, the agency should publish the names of all third-party requesters;\r\n> the agency should also alert requesters that they will publish the names of\r\n> third-party requesters in their FOIA logs.\r\n> d) Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the\r\n> request.\r\n> e) Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well.\r\n> f) Subject matter of the request.\r\n> g) Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.).\r\n> h) For requests that have been closed, the date closed and the result of\r\n> the FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\n> i) Fee Information\r\n> a.

Apart from the FOIA\r\n> Advisory Committee recommendation that agencies should proactively post\r\n> their FOIA logs, the logs exist in any event and are subject to prompt\r\n> release under the FOIA.\r\n> 3. I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency\r\n> record that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA\r\n> request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release\r\n> of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n> 4. See PDF for complete FOIA Reqeust. See Requested Format.\r\n> 5. Although I am seeking expedited processing and prompt release of all\r\n> records, I am seeking a rolling release of those records that are\r\n> immediately available followed by a list of additional searches and\r\n> estimated completion dates for them.\r\n>\r\n> REQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n>\r\n> I am seeking all correspondence through MUCKROCK.com.\r\n>\r\n> I am seeking a PDF file with thru MUCKROCK.com with: (1) a signed and\r\n> dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control\r\n> number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a\r\n> copy of this request in your reply. I seek records in this format with an\r\n> imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing\r\n> the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents\r\n> stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any\r\n> subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n>\r\n> Further, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in\r\n> which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA\r\n> Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format,\r\n> it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n>\r\n> Each record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format.\r\n> I am also seeking the \u201cDescription Available to the Public\u201d field I\r\n> FOIAonline be set to yes and that all records be released to and viewable\r\n> in the application by the general Public.

The next and final FOIA Advisory Committee of the 2020 \u2013 2022 Term is\r\n> June 9, 2022, where this matter will be discussed. This is the final term\r\n> of this committee\r\n> b.

Please refer further to my FOIA Public Comments regarding the March 29,\r\n> 2022 Senate Oversight Committee FOIA Hearings, wherein DOJ OIP and NARA\u2019s\r\n> OGIS were slammed for lack of FOIA compliance oversight.\r\n> d.

We provided you with the documents from that request on October 3, 2023.  For this particular request, we provided you with a cost estimate to produce the records of $11.52, which has not been paid.  Accordingly, we closed this request for lack of payment.  If you would like to make the $11.52 payment, then we will re-open your request.

All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, that was written by or sent to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present date that contains the following words or phrases:\r\n\u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cballot(s)\u201d, \u201celection fraud\u201d, and \u201cballot fraud\u201d\r\n2. All memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, to and from the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to the present that has a subject matter relating to \u201coperational changes\u201d\r\n3. All memos and correspondence written to or from the office of the Inspector General from 5/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201corganizational changes\u201d, and \u201c2020 election\u201d\r\n4. All email correspondence between high-ranking officials at USPS from 7/1/2020 to the present that contains the following words and/or phrases:\r\n\u201cLouis DeJoy\u201d, \u201cchanges\u201d, \u201cethics\u201d, \u201ccomplaints\u201d, \u201c2020 election\u201d, \u201cmail-in ballots\u201d, and \u201corganizational changes\u201d\r\n5. All data sheets from 5/1/2020 that describe organizational changes in the operation of the United States Postal Service\r\n6. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to the present \r\n7. All communications between the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020\r\nFee Waiver:\r\nI hereby request that all fees be waived as this is a matter of public interest.\r\n1. The records that are being requested concerns \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d. This is since the Postmaster General acts as the decision making body that is in charge of determining whether changes are to be made inside the United States Postal Service. Also, the OIG acts as a watchdog over USPS and thus is in and of itself participating in \u201cthe operation or activities of the government\u201d.\r\n2. The documents requested will contribute to the understanding of the stated \u201coperation or activities of the government\u201d. The documents requested will allow for insight into the decision for the USPS to be processing mail more slowly and alerting that mail-in ballots might not get to voters on time. There have been calls made by members of Congress to investigate said activities as well. This significance of said records have been demonstrated through various news outlets as well as a letter by a senator.\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-letter-usps-practices/index.html\r\n3. The records requested directly impacts millions of Americans that will be voting by mail in the upcoming election. This is since these records will provide insight into how mail-in voting will operate through the United States Postal Service. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many Americans will decide to vote by mail instead of voting in person. In a survey conducted in May 2020, 64% of Americans were in favor of voting by mail (https://news.gallup.com/poll/310586/americans-favor-voting-mail-option-november.aspx). These records will allow the public to determine whether or not it will be the best option to vote by mail. This is since these records can show or not show whether or not the systematic changes in the United States Postal Service will have a direct impact on whether a voter decides to vote by mail or not. This will also allow for due diligence to be made by states in order to make sure that every vote is counted in the appropriate manner. The documents will be available publicly and will be disseminated across news outlets in order to inform the public. \r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html\r\n4. The documents requested will allow for a clear understanding of \u201cthe operations and activities of government\u201d. Presently, the public doesn\u2019t have information to evaluate as to whether the changes made in USPS will impact how mail-in voting will occur in the upcoming election. This is since there is no information that is readily available as it is breaking news and has recently been covered by news outlets. Currently, the Speaker of the House is requesting a hearing where the present Postmaster General is requested to appear and testify (https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/democrats-usps-postal-service-investigation/index.html). These documents will be able to direct the course of the congressional hearing as it will give insight into the changes in operation at the United States Postal Service.\r\nExpedited Processing\r\n1. I hereby request expedited processing for this request as well. I am not a member of the news media however I am submitting this request through a platform (Muckrock.com), whose primary purpose is to disseminate information. As such, the mode of disseminating information is valid as meeting the first prong for being \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public regarding the requested documents. The current subject matter is ongoing as shown through various news outlets covering the story. This is an urgent matter to all Americans as it directly relates to the processing of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election.\r\nList:\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-demand-postmaster-general-usps-chairman-testify-urgently-on-sabotage-of-postal-service.amp\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/trump-administration-postal-service-elections/index.html\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/taylor-swift-slams-trumps-calculated-dismantling-usps-rcna83\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/08/15/902811968/trump-offers-conflicting-statements-on-mail-in-voting-usps-funding\r\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/13/us-postal-service-whats-going-post-office-what-we-know/3360565001/\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/usps-vote-mail.html\r\n2. This is currently a breaking news story whose value would be diminished without these records. Also, there is currently a pending request to have the Postmaster General appear in Congress in order to testify. The previous news releases demonstrates the urgency in obtaining these records.\r\n3. The requested records clearly concerns federal government activity. This is since the records will explain the process taken that has caused USPS to have organizational changes. Also, it will determine whether there was any wrongdoing based on possible records that will show communications with specific words that will be instrumental in evaluating the decisions made by the Postmaster General.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarlos Gamez\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Gamez:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your August 17 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for records related to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to Postmaster General (PMG) Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"mail in ballots\", \"2020 election\", \"ballot(s)\", \"election fraud\", \"ballot fraud\".\r\n  2.  Memos and correspondence, electronic or physical, written by or sent to PMG Louis DeJoy from 3/2/2020 to present having a subject matter relating to \"operational changes\".\r\n  3.  Memos or correspondence written to or from the OIG from 5/1/2020 to present containing \"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\".\r\n  4.  Email correspondence between high-ranking officials at the U.S. Postal Service from 7/1/2020 to present containing the words or phrases \"Louis DeJoy\", \"changes\", \"ethics\", \"complaints\", \"2020 election\", \"mail in ballots\", and \"organizational changes\".\r\n  5.  All data sheets from 5/1/2020 describing organizational changes in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n  6.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and White House staff from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n  7.  All communications between PMG Louis DeJoy and President Donald Trump from 7/1/2020 to present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgement is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office, along with the St Louis Requester Service Center, is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Information on the USPIS is available on the Internet at: https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG's mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \"oversight authority\" for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause records related to items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 would be potentially maintained by the Postal Service, we have referred your request to their FOIA office for processing and direct response to you. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them online at https://pfoiapal.usps.com/, via email at foia12@usps.gov<mailto:foia12@usps.gov>, via phone at (202) 268-2608, via fax at (202) 268-5353, or in writing at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal Service Records Office\r\n\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P830\r\n\r\nWashington, DC  20260-4541\r\n\r\nRegarding item #3, in order for us to process this portion of your request, under C.F.R. Title 39 \u00a7 265.3(c) requires requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Therefore, we will need you to please provide a listing of the names of any OIG employees you wish us to search against. Limiting the number of names you provide will substantially increase the time it takes to locate and process any responsive records.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive the listing of OIG employee names, in order to conduct an adequate search for these records, we would need to do a data transfer of the entire mailbox of each individual you choose to name (to include inbox, sent items, and deleted items) and place these data files in a secure location. At this point, FOIA staff will be able to conduct key word search of \"\"2020 election\", \"Louis DeJoy\", \"organizational changes\", and \"2020 election\", and/or any other search term you may suggest.  We would then need to review each data file for responsiveness before conducting a line-by-line examination to determine what information may be released in accordance with FOIA regulations. We understand this portion of your request to be for memos or correspondence related to \"organizational changes\" recently in the news at the Postal Service, not the OIG. Be advised e-mails are not considered an established system of records under the Privacy Act and would be considered for release only under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive a listing of named OIG employee profiles by COB September 15, we will presume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request and will close your file, but you may file again later. You may return the completed form via e-mail at foia@uspsoig.gov<mailto:foia@uspsoig.gov> or U.S. Mail at 1735 N. Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

The FOIA allows agencies twenty (20) working days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) to process requests.  In unusual circumstances, agencies may qualify for further extensions, and may request a modified FOIA request and/or time frame for response.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\n\r\n\u201cUnusual circumstances\u201d apply to the processing of a request if one or more of the following apply:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another department or agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii).\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as timely notice that unusual circumstances apply to your request as a result of item outlined above. As such, we are extending the response period until December 2, 2022, instead of September 30, 2022, as stated in my previous correspondence.  You will be contacted on or immediately after that date.\r\n\r\nAgain, please accept my apologies for the delay response.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nNancy P. Chavannes\r\nDeputy Chief FOIA Officer",

I apologize if my initial request was unclear and I am happy to provide additional clarification.\r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting records related to radar and beacons that may have encountered Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) or anomalous aircraft. These records could include radar data, flight logs, and other documentation regarding incidents of UAP sightings or encounters reported by the United States Navy from January 1, 2016, to the present date.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I am seeking inter-agency communications, memos, messages, and any other relevant documentation related to the incident(s) in question. This could include any emails, reports, or other communications regarding the tracking, analysis, or investigation of UAP sightings or encounters.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to request any relevant terms, keywords or acronyms that may have been used by the Navy to identify these incidents, such as \"unidentified aerial phenomena\", \"UAPs\", \"unknown tracks\", \"anomalous aerial vehicles\", \"unidentified flying objects\", \"UFOs\", or any other similar terminology. I would also like to request any search queries or methodologies used to identify and catalog these types of incidents.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am requesting the documents in their entirety, including any deleted or redacted information. If any information has been redacted or withheld, please provide a detailed explanation for the redaction or withholding. Please also provide any legal justifications for withholding any responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees associated with fulfilling this request, please notify me in advance of fulfilling my request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Bruce Blair, whose death has been widely\r\n    reported in the New York Times.
