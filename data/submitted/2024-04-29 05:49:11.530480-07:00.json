I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to, mentioning, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry for Donald David DeFreeze, aka Cinque Mtume, aka General Field Marshal Cinque (November 16, 1943 \u2013 May 17, 1974).\r\n\r\nThis information has already been released previously. Page 11 of the FBI's 2003 FOIA log, attached, indicates journalist Tom O'Neill filed FOIPA request 961930-001 the year prior. The bureau reopened the request on May 15, 2003, and closed it again on May 3, 2005. The log discloses that 1,812 pages were released as part of that request, thus I am requesting all information previously released in that request and any additional information released since then.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. DeFreeze's privacy, as he passed away in 1974. I have attached a reproduction of an obituary, published in The New York Times on May 24, 1974.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

This should include all official communications, memos, directives, and policy documents he authored or was involved in.\r\n\r\nMeetings and Correspondences: All schedules, meeting notes, and correspondence involving Mr. Cohen-Watnick related to his duties in these roles. Please include meetings with external entities, other government agencies, and international counterparts.\r\n\r\nProjects and Initiatives: Information about any projects or initiatives that Mr. Cohen-Watnick spearheaded or was significantly involved in during his tenure, including any related to special operations, intelligence operations, or defense strategies.\r\n\r\nPersonnel Decisions and Influence: Records reflecting any personnel decisions influenced or made by Mr. Cohen-Watnick, including but not limited to hiring, promotions, reassignments, and dismissals.\r\nInteragency Communications: Copies of any interagency communications that Mr. Cohen-Watnick was a part of, particularly relating to U.S. national security and defense intelligence strategies.\r\n\r\nBriefings and Reports: Copies of briefings and reports prepared by or presented to Mr. Cohen-Watnick, especially those concerning special operations and intelligence matters.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees for this request.

I will also expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nAs I am making this request in the public interest, for non-commercial use, I request that you expedite the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The management of this project area is of the utmost interest to our supporters and readers. I will use the requested information to further the public\u2019s understanding of the BLM management and we will disseminate the information through news channels.\r\n\r\nI also request that you waive any applicable fees because the requested material is clearly in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d This request complies with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 because the furnished information will be used to inform the public of how the federal government is managing vegetation, wildlife and watersheds public lands as well as responding to the protected first amendment right to peacefully protest. These documents concern the operations and activities of the Medford BLM various employees from HR personnel, Law Enforcement and NEPA planners. The release of these documents will enhance the public\u2019s understanding of the BLM management and inform the public as to whether the BLM has complied with its duties. I have no commercial interest in these documents.\r\n\r\nThrough destination these records will allow a reasonably broad audiences to better understand BLM management activities.\r\n\r\nThe requested information is \u201cnew\u201d in that it is currently unavailable to the public. Disclosure of the information will clarify BLM activities concerning resources of public concern.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the fee waiver is denied, I reserve the right to appeal such decision. However, I anticipate that the BLM will make the requested materials available within the statutorily prescribed period. Access to the records should be granted within twenty working days from your receipt of this request. Failure to respond in a timely manner shall be viewed as a denial of this request. Time is of the essence.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
