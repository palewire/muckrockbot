Aranka Heller) (May 19, 1898 \u2013 January 1997)\r\n\r\nEach of these individuals is included in the FBI RIDS Dead List (https://ia803107.us.archive.org/6/items/FBIRIDsDeadList2018/RIDSDeadList-2019.pdf) and inclusion in this list is sufficient to show proof of death. \r\n\r\nI am aware that there are preprocessed records available for most, if not all, of these subjects. Please both reprocess these records as previously claimed exemptions may no longer be applicable. Additionally, please perform an additional search for records for each of those subjects, beyond existing preprocessed records. In particular, the FBI should have additional records on Bobby Fischer beyond the 10 pages available in the Vault, as the Vault does not contain records related to several possible interactions between Fischer and the FBI, including any cross-references, anything related to his  1992 indictment, and any records related to his 1972 and 1992 matches with Boris Spassky.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nShreyas Gandlur",

We received your request on September 8, 2020.  Your\r\nrequest concerns FBI files.\r\n\r\nThis office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration's *operational *records (records created by this\r\nagency).  Your request is for *archival* records (records created by or\r\noriginated in a different agency, but that may have been transferred to the\r\nlegal custody of NARA) to which access is restricted.  Therefore, we have\r\nforwarded it to our *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA*\r\nstaff who handle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number, and respond\r\ndirectly to you.  In the future, if you need to follow up with that office,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives and Records Administration\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Staff (RF)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nBy phone: 301-837-3190\r\nBy fax: 301-837-1864\r\nBy email: specialaccess_foia@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request is below.  In the future, we\r\nencourage you to submit requests electronically since many of our staff are\r\nworking remotely, and we have limited access to our mailroom.  If you have\r\nfuture requests for FBI files, please submit them directly to Special\r\nAccess and FOIA at their email address above.  Also, please send all status\r\nupdate requests to the same email address.   It helps to attach any\r\nresponse you received from the FBI telling you the records have been\r\ntransferred to NARA.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia  for information about\r\nwhen and how to file a FOIA request with NARA.  On our main website,\r\nwww.archives.gov, you can learn more about the resources that we offer to\r\nthe public, and access our online catalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), federal agencies have adjusted their\r\nnormal operations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical\r\nwork while also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the\r\nsafety of our staff.  As a result of this re-prioritization of activities,\r\nyou may experience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.

Aranka Heller) (May 19, 1898 \u2013 January 1997)\r\n\r\nEach of these individuals is included in the FBI RIDS Dead List (https://ia803107.us.archive.org/6/items/FBIRIDsDeadList2018/RIDSDeadList-2019.pdf) and inclusion in this list is sufficient to show proof of death.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are preprocessed records available for most, if not all, of these subjects. Please both reprocess these records as previously claimed exemptions may no longer be applicable. Additionally, please perform an additional search for records for each of those subjects, beyond existing preprocessed records. In particular, the FBI should have additional records on Bobby Fischer beyond the 10 pages available in the Vault, as the Vault does not contain records related to several possible interactions between Fischer and the FBI, including any cross-references, anything related to his 1992 indictment, and any records related to his 1972 and 1992 matches with Boris Spassky.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nShreyas Gandlur",

Your request was received in this office on\r\nSeptember 3, 2020, and assigned FOIA tracking number 64611, interim\r\ntracking number RF-264.\r\n\r\nYou requested FBI records related to the following individuals: Robert\r\n\"Bobby\" James Fischer, Regina Wender Fischer, Hans-Gerhardt Fisher, Paul\r\nFelix Nemenyi, Peter Bjorn Nemenyi, Joan Fischer Targ, Aranka Nemeni\r\n(Aranka Heller).\r\n\r\nWe conducted a search of all available indexes transferred to the National\r\nArchives.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to identify any FBI case files at the National Archives\r\nrelated to Robert \u201cBobby\u201d James Fischer, Aranka Nemenyi (Aranka Heller),\r\nPaul Felix Nemenyi, or Joan Fischer Tar. It is possible that records\r\nrelating to these individuals are still in the custody of the FBI. If you\r\nhave not done so already, you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the FBI\r\nfor a search of their files for records relating to your subjects.\r\nInformation about how to submit a FOIA request with the FBI is available on\r\ntheir website at\r\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/services/records-management/foipa/requesting-fbi-records\r\n.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to locate any files on Hans-Gerhart (Gerardo, Girard,\r\nGerard) Fischer, however, the index indicated there may be documents which\r\nreference that name in file 100-HQ-138643, which is about the Soviet\r\nPurchasing Commission. The file consists of 112 sections, with an estimated\r\n24,000 pages. Based on our initial evaluation, this file is deemed\r\nunresponsive to your request because Hans-Gerhart Fischer is not the\r\nsubject of the file. Unless we receive a response from you within ninety\r\n(90) calendar days from the date of this letter to indicate you believe\r\nthese records are responsive, we will not include this file in your request.\r\n\r\nWe located the following files responsive to your request:\r\n\r\nWe identified Regina Fischer as the subject of the following files:\r\n\r\nFBI File 65-HQ-45667, created between October 1942 and November 1972, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 1400 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-NY-102290, created between December 1950 and March 1989, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 1000 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-WFO-27777, created between May 1953 and August 1961, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-CG-27015, created between April 1953 and March 1960, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 400 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe identified Peter Bjorn Nemenyi as the subject of the following file:\r\n\r\nFBI File 100-RH-10957, created between July 1969 and September 1969, and\r\nconsisting of an estimated 15 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under the\r\nFOIA <https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine>:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is 2915 pages. Requests for\r\nbetween 701 and 3,000 pages are assigned to our second-tier processing\r\nqueue. To give you an indication of our existing second-tier backlog, we\r\nare currently processing requests received in June 2014.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $2,332.00.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed.

ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\" 2) All emails exchanges-including incoming messages, outgoing messages, forwards, and attachments-between the department's public information and/or media relations staff members and ShotSpotter representatives since January 1, 2021. ShotSpotter representatives can be identified by searching the department's email system for addresses ending in \"@shotspotter.com.\"\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA search located 94 pages of records, in the attached two files, responsive to this FOIA request.  Upon review, I have determined to withhold portions of the released records pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2), which exempts personal privacy information, the release of which would constitute a(n) (clearly) unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  The withheld information includes names/personal identifiers and other personal privacy information, including that which would lead to the identity of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no charges for FOIA services, in this instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this letter to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office  of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>.  Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Eckert\r\n\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month<https://nationaltoday.com/national-developmental-disabilities-awareness-month-2>.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) has communicated, albeit without specific legal citations, that \"In 1945, the expenditure of public funds payable as dues to the Association was given a legal foundation in Education Law by the state Legislature.\" In light of this statement, I am seeking access to records under the New York State Freedom of Information Law that could provide clarification and documentation of this legal foundation. My request includes:\r\n\r\n-Legislative Documents: I am requesting copies of legislative documents, memoranda, or official notices from around 1945 that detail the authorization for school districts to use public funds for NYSSBA membership dues. This includes any legislative acts or amendments specifically enabling such expenditures.\r\n\r\n-Official Correspondence: I seek any official correspondence between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and NYSSBA, dating from 1945 to the current day, which discusses or references the legal basis for using public funds for NYSSBA dues.\r\n\r\n-Policy Documents: I am interested in obtaining any policy documents, guidelines, or bulletins issued by NYSED that address or relate to the expenditure of public funds for the purpose of NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\nI recognize the importance of making my request specific and actionable. This request is aimed at accessing existing, identifiable records without requiring your department to undertake legal interpretation or generate new documentation.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the timeframe specified in my request, spanning from 1945 to the present, may present a broad scope that could potentially place an undue burden on your department. Therefore, I would like to emphasize my openness to partial responses. If locating documents from the entire period specified proves to be overly burdensome, I kindly request that the department prioritize the search and provision of documents from the following more focused timeframes, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n-Documents from the year 1945/1946 itself, given its specific mention in the context of providing legal foundation for school districts' expenditures on NYSSBA membership dues.\r\n\r\n-Key documents from significant legislative or policy milestones related to this matter, should they be readily identifiable by your department.\r\n\r\nThis approach is intended to balance the need for thoroughness with practical considerations regarding the volume of records and the effort required to retrieve them. My goal is to facilitate a manageable and effective search process that aligns with both our interests in accessing relevant public records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if during the process of fulfilling this request, specific documents are identified that would substantially respond to the core of my inquiry, I am amenable to narrowing the scope further based on your suggestions. Your expertise and understanding of the department's records could provide valuable guidance in focusing this request more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Specifically, you request copies of any records that \"could provide clarification and documentation\" of the statute, including legislative documents, policy documents, and official correspondence.\r\n\r\nA diligent search was made for records responsive to your request, and the following records were located and copied:\r\n\r\n[1.] Governor's \"bill jacket\" for Laws of 1945, Chapter 92 (in State Archives record series 12950), which enacted what is now Education Law sect. 1618. The bill jacket contains a copy of the bill that was enacted, as well as comments on the bill. The jacket has been scanned, and a link to the digital file will be transmitted to you in a separate e-mail.\r\n\r\n[2.] Legal opinions of the Commissioner of Education relating to sect. 1618, found in 1 Education Department Reports 718 and 5 Education Department Reports 232. Digital copies of those published opinions are attached.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that after a diligent search, no \"policy documents\" or \"official correspondence\" concerning sect. 1618 were found in the correspondence and subject files of the Commissioner of Education that have been transferred to the State Archives by the State Education Department. Under my direction, staff searched the Commissioner's correspondence and subject files dating from 1945 through 2014, and no documents responsive to your request were located. More recent subject and correspondence files have not been transferred to the Archives.\r\n\r\nBecause no policy documents or official correspondence were located, you may appeal this partial denial of your request by sending a letter within thirty (30) days to Dr. Betty Rosa, Commissioner of Education, New York State Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12234.

Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Currently, your request is in the review stage. \nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.

Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request within 90 to 120 days.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \nSorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience. \n\nSincerely, \nReNay Royster ReNay.Royster@treasury.gov FOIA@treasury.gov\n",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

These are reports where personnel have reached out to Shotspotter for support, because the system failed to detect a shooting or misclassified an incident. According to ShotSpotter, their best practices include steps to ensure that if police officers conclude the ShotSpotter alert was indeed a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d they report that the company to \"keep track and take remedial steps to minimize false positives in the future\". I am looking for any such feedback given to ShotSpotter. \r\n\r\n- Any emails between department staff with the words \"false positive\" and \"Shotspotter\" or \"shot spotter\" or \"sound thinking\". Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\n\r\n- Copies of all SoundThinking (Shotspotter) responses to aforementioned notification reports, Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed. \r\nThe City has located records responsive to your request.\u00a0 You can log into the system by clicking the following link and download your responsive records. \r\nPolice Public Records Request - P141315-103023\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while we worked through this.\u00a0 Your\u00a0request will now be closed. \r\n\r\nRecords Section \r\nCincinnati Police Department",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCharles Jeter",

Please provide each deliverable 1-5, or itemize and concatenate as per the request order for pricing and delivery.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. Please provide this metadata and note that no per-page fee should be levied.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to Duane Ramsdell \"Dewey\" Clarridge (April 16, 1932 \u2013 April 9, 2016), who was a senior operations officer for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and supervisor for more than 30 years. Clarridge was the chief of the Latin American division from 1981 to 1987 and a key figure in the Iran-Contra Affair. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/us/duane-r-clarridge-brash-spy-who-fought-terror-dies-at-83.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nFOIA case law establishes the extent to which agencies MUST search all records system reasonably believed to contain responsive documents, even if it means contacting former employees. Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990) makes it explicitly clear that it is the obligation of the Department to \u201cconduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\u201d In addition, the Justice Department\u2019s May 2004 FOIA Guide states that an agency \u201ccannot limit its search to only one record system if there are others that are likely to turn up the information requested.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

Include any correspondence from within City of Cortez where the email address which is inbound or outbound or cc'd: matthewkeefauver@aim.com or mkeefauver@cortezco.gov or any other emails corresponding to this individual.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me the following information for all emails sent or cc'd into the City's emails from Jan. 1 2000 to the present to/from/cc/bcc the above-listed accounts:\r\n\r\n1. From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Anna Chennault, born Chan Sheng Mai later spelt Chen Xiangmei (\u9673\u9999\u6885, actual birth year 1923 but reported as June 23, 1925 \u2013 March 30, 2018), also known as Anna Chan Chennault or Anna Chen Chennault, was a war correspondent and prominent Republican member of the US China Lobby. After her husband's death, Anna Chennault worked as a publicist for the Civil Air Transport in Taipei, Taiwan (1946\u20131957) and was vice-president of international affairs for the Flying Tiger Line that was founded by a former Flying Tiger pilot, and was president of TAC International (from 1976). In 1960, Chennault had her first political experience when she campaigned for Richard Nixon, being used as the Republican principal campaigner among Chinese-Americans. She was an occasional correspondent for the Central News Agency (from 1965) and the US correspondent for the Hsin Shen Daily News (from 1958). She was a broadcaster for the Voice of America from 1963 to 1966.  Cartha \"Deke\" DeLoach, then FBI Deputy Director, mentioned in his book Hoover's FBI that his agency was able to connect a single November 2, 1968 phone call from the then Vice President candidate Spiro Agnew to Anna Chennault, unrecorded details of which Johnson believed were subsequently transmitted to Nixon.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Anna Chennault, born Chan Sheng Mai later spelt Chen Xiangmei (\u9673\u9999\u6885,\r\n    actual birth year 1923 but reported as June 23, 1925 \u2013 March 30, 2018), also\r\n    known as Anna Chan Chennault or Anna Chen Chennault, was a war correspondent\r\n    and prominent Republican member of the US China Lobby. After her husband's\r\n    death, Anna Chennault worked as a publicist for the Civil Air Transport in\r\n    Taipei, Taiwan (1946\u20131957) and was vice-president of international affairs\r\n    for the Flying Tiger Line that was founded by a former Flying Tiger pilot,\r\n    and was president of TAC International (from 1976). In 1960, Chennault had\r\n    her first political experience when she campaigned for Richard Nixon, being\r\n    used as the Republican principal campaigner among Chinese-Americans. She was\r\n    an occasional correspondent for the Central News Agency (from 1965) and the\r\n    US correspondent for the Hsin Shen Daily News (from 1958). She was a\r\n    broadcaster for the Voice of America from 1963 to 1966. Cartha \"Deke\"\r\n    DeLoach, then FBI Deputy Director, mentioned in his book Hoover's FBI that\r\n    his agency was able to connect a single November 2, 1968 phone call from the\r\n    then Vice President candidate Spiro Agnew to Anna Chennault, unrecorded\r\n    details of which Johnson believed were subsequently transmitted to Nixon.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation\n",

DCYF will also be working closely with the Department of Health which provides oversight for the behavioral and substance treatment centers to provide them with information about CPS investigations at these locations.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about reporting suspected child abuse or neglect, visit https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/safety/report-abuse.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

That support level would increase based on additional needs of the child, including support for adolescents, chronic physical health, developmental disabilities, and mental health.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Caregiver Support Rates chart [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2023/12/28/file_attachments/2731309/Caregiver%20Supports%20Rates.pdf ] \r\n\r\n\"We know that caregivers who have children and youth with higher needs, need more support to care for them,\" said DCYF Secretary Ross Hunter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, DCYF is changing its rate assessment process. DCYF will begin to use the child\u2019s case file, information gathered from the child, parents, family, and other important individuals in the child\u2019s life, and health history information to determine support level.\r\n\r\nIf a caregiver believes information about the child's needs was not considered in a level determination, they have the opportunity to appeal. Caregivers can request rate determination review any time there is a change in circumstances or a new diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\"The new process will help us identify\u00a0a child\u2019s needs and help us link caregivers to the supports that are best suited for the child in their care,\" explained Hunter. \"By better preparing\u00a0caregivers to support children and youth placed in their care, we should see an increase in placement stability.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nDCYF has removed barriers for kinship caregivers to become licensed to care for the children in their home. If they have an approved home study, kin most likely already meet the requirements for a kinship license. Once licensed, the children in their care are eligible to receive monthly foster care maintenance payments to assist in meeting their needs.\r\n\r\nLastly, caregivers licensed by child placing agencies will begin to be paid directly by DCYF.\u00a0The new caregiver supports model marks the first time the rates and process have undergone major changes in over two decades.\u00a0The change is part of a larger project aimed at implementing a continuum of placement resources that enable safe, stable, and supported placements for children in the care of DCYF.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about DCYF's Caregiver Supports project, visit:\u00a0*https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project* [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/foster-parenting/caregiver-supports-project ].\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:\r\n*Nancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

It is likewise a serious barrier to reunifying children with their parents,\" Washington State Court Administrator Dawn Marie Rubio said at the signing ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Office of the Courts played a critical role to bring all three branches of government together to come to this agreement.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver the years, there has been a lack of capacity in parts of the state, but through this partnership, DCYF and public housing authority and non-profits will now be able to serve more youth and families with housing statewide. Eligible families and youth will receive referrals from their DCYF caseworker to a contracted provider who will help them locate housing that accepts vouchers.\r\n\r\nMichael Mirra, retired executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority and co-chair of the Housing and Child Welfare Subcommittee, said the agreement will imbed housing into the child welfare system. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will spare children and families from the trauma of avoidable out-of-home placement, it will house teenagers coming from foster care or juvenile rehabilitation who would otherwise start their independent adulthood by becoming homeless, it will help the state\u2019s child welfare workers perform what may be the hardest job in public service; and it will save the state money in averted foster care costs,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\nLowel Krueger, executive director of the Yakima Housing Authority said folks from the Association of Washington Housing Authorities were grateful for all of the partners who \"persisted in establishing this innovative collaboration to provide families involved in the child welfare system with housing, a critical first step in helping families and changing life outcomes for children.\"\r\n\r\nDCYF\u2019s ability to begin to provide the contracted Housing Supportive Services that are necessary to fulfill its commitment to HUD was made possible through $8 million in investments from the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to sign this historic document with all the partnerships and what it means for the families we serve,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cWhen our youth and families are supported, they thrive, preventing deeper penetration into the child welfare system.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter with folks from the Housing Authorities photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787090/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20with%20folks%20from%20the%20Housing%20Authorities.jpg ]\r\n\r\nDCYF Secretary Ross Hunter Signing MOU photo [ https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADEL/2024/02/16/file_attachments/2787091/DCYF%20Secretary%20Ross%20Hunter%20Signing%20MOU.jpg ]\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n*Contacts:*\r\n\r\nNancy Gutierrez, Communications Administrator | nancy.gutierrez@dcyf.wa.gov\u00a0| 360-742-6418\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nContact Us [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/contact-us ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0DCYF Offices & Regional Map [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DCYFMap-offices.pdf ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Media [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/media ]\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0Jobs at DCYF [ https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/about/jobs ]\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n Questions?\r\nContact Us <communications@dcyf.wa.gov>  Stay Connected Visit us on Facebook [ https://www.facebook.com/waDCYF/ ] Visit us on Twitter [ https://twitter.com/waDCYF ] Sign up for email updates <communications@dcyf.wa.gov> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\nUpdate your subscriptions, modify your password or email address or stop subscriptions at any time on your Subscriber Preferences Page [ https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADEL/subscriber/new?preferences=true ].

Deloitte maintains several systems for the Department.  Each is maintained differently both externally and internally.  Furthermore, there is no official \u201cchange request\u201d procedure that covers all systems maintained by Deloitte.  Is there a specific system (i.e. ACCESS; CCWIS) that you are looking at?  Knowing this would assist in our search for the records.  Let me know so we can continue our search and develop an accurate cost estimate (if one is needed).\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\nJohn M.
