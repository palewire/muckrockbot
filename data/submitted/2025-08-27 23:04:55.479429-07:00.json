The Stewart Detention Center has the highest number of deaths in ICE custody of any facility in the ICE detention since FY17. \r\n2. Stewart is currently one of the most populated sites of detention in the ICE system. \r\n3. Calls to 911 in 2025 from Stewart have exceeded their numbers for any period over the past five years. \r\n4. Audio recordings of Stewart 911 calls reflect instances in which EMS units were unavailable to treat significant illnesses or injuries as a result of previous calls from the facility.\r\n5. Lack of access to timely emergency medical care threatens the health safety of people in Stewart and the surrounding community. \r\n6. ICE Mortality Reviewers have attributed lack of timely access to emergency medical care to a significant number of deaths in ICE custody. \r\n7. The records requested will shed light on whether, and to what extent, ICE is aware of the challenges posed and consequences created by its use of detention in high numbers at the Stewart facility. \r\n8. DHS-OIG, ICE OPR, IHSC, ICE ODO, Congress, and the General Accountability Office have all previously cited CoreCivic, ICE's Atlanta Field Office, and Stewart for violations of ICE's standards and contracts. \r\n9. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications, and have previously been granted expedited processing by federal FOIA offices on this basis. \r\n10. These records are needed on an expedited basis to fill out the federal side of a piece for which I have received journalism grant funding and which will be published no later than October.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
