I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

We received your email requesting clarification\r\nabout our methodology in responding to your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we detailed to you in a previous communication, many of our public\r\nrecords requests concern students and staff. We have approximately 136\r\npublic records requests that are responsive to your request that require 3rd\r\nparty notification related to hundreds of people.\r\n                                           2020-2021- 28 requests require 3\r\nrd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2018-2019 \u2013 13\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n                                                          2012-2017 \u2013 95\r\nrequests require 3rd party notification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7       With our last installment, we have provided to you, in reverse\r\nchronological order, all requests for records covering 2012-2021 that do\r\nnot require 3rd party notification.  Next we will be providing non-exempt\r\nrecords responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\u00b7       After those installments, we will move on to the requests that\r\nrequire 3rd party notification, allowing time for affected parties to seek\r\ninjunctions if they so choose.  Absent injunctions, we will then provide\r\nnon-exempt records responsive to those requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our responsive records are available electronically, but many from\r\n2012 \u2013 2017 are in paper form and will need to be scanned into PDFs.\r\nEmails are printed and then scanned to PDF for production.  We are making\r\nsteady progress in fulfilling your request but are unable to give an exact\r\ndate when the request will be completed in full.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiana S.

The section that addresses per diem (room and board) for offenders on work release starts on page .0314. This policy is under review for updating.\r\nThe other attachment pertains to offender co-pays for medical services. It also is currently being reviewed for possible revisions.\r\nHere is the information on offender payments for room and board and restitution that you requested for fiscal year 2021:\r\n\r\nCategory\r\nOffender Cost Amount\r\nNumber of Offenders\r\nPer Diem (room & board)\r\n$15,420.00\r\n104\r\nRestitution\r\n$13,149.77\r\n32\r\n\r\nThis is previously exiting information.\r\nThe Department does not have existing reports pertaining to the specific information you requested on the amount of medical co-pays paid by offenders in 2021. As you may be aware, N.C. General Statute \u00a7 132-6.2.(e) does not \"require a public agency to respond to a request for a copy of a public record by creating or compiling a record that does not exist.\" As a result, we have no responsive public records to that part of your information request.\nThis concludes your March 31, 2023 public records request.",

Code Ann. 10-7-503 et seq.). We appreciate your offer to narrow the request. Please see the following revised request: \r\n\r\nRecords Requested:\r\n\r\nAll written and electronic communications of Tennessee Technological University administrators or staff between September 7, 2022, and October 31, 2022, regarding:\r\n\r\n1. Tennessee Tech student groups Lambda Gay-Straight Alliance and/or Tech Players; and\r\n2. The August 20, 2022 Drag at the Backdoor event at the Backdoor Playhouse.\r\n\r\nFee waiver request: Please note that this request concerns a matter of public interest. The protection of First Amendment free speech rights at public universities, like Tennessee Tech, is of vital concern to the students, faculty, and administrators of that university, and to the greater academic community and the public at large. This request seeks records regarding Tennessee Tech\u2019s ongoing punishment of students for exercising their First Amendment right to host an expressive campus event. The records are not sought for a commercial or personal interest, but rather for the purpose of providing the public with information concerning civil liberties in higher education.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is not granted, please apprise me of the estimated cost of fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n",

His death is widely-known and widely reported, and was even the subject of a February 2020 documentary by BBC Persian; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh immigrated to the United States in 1959, and attended Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service from 1959 to 1963. He participated in student protests against the Iranian government, and stormed a party held by Ardeshir Zadehi, then-Iranian ambassador in Washington. Soviet defector Vladimir Kuzichkin later claimed in his 1991 book, Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality, that Qotbzadeh had been an agent of Soviet military intelligence during this time.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh became a close aides to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and participated in the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was arrested in April 1982 on charges of plotting a coup d'etat, and was executed in September of that year.\r\n\r\nI previously requested records for Qotbzadeh, request number 1484136-000.\r\n\r\nIn your 29 January 2021 response to that request, you noted that \r\n\r\nAs I wrote in my initial 22 December 2020 request, \"If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\" However, your 29 January 2021 response letter states that you \"consider [the] request fulfilled\" after releasing documents from a previous search. As the letter continues, \"additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist,\" and I \"may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nI am requesting that additional search.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. \r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

If there is more information you need, but cannot find on that website, then potentially the Alabama Department of Finance Comptroller\u2019s Office may be able to help you further.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerena Cronier | Assistant Attorney General\r\nPhone: 334.353.1985 | serena.cronier@arec.alabama.gov<mailto:serena.cronier@arec.alabama.gov>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D96EBE.9175D340]\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D96EBE.9175D340]<http://www.facebook.com/arecalabamagov> [cid:image003.png@01D96EBE.9175D340] <http://www.instagram.com/arecalabamagov>  [cid:image004.png@01D96EBE.9175D340] <http://www.twitter.com/arecalabamagov>  [cid:image005.png@01D96EBE.9175D340] <https://www.youtube.com/user/ARECalabamagov>\r\n\r\nConfidentiality Notice: The information contained in this email and the documents attached hereto contain confidential information intended only for the use of the intended recipients.

Stuart Christie was jailed in Spain in 1964 for his involvement in a plot to assassinated Francisco Franco. He was released from prison after four years, and was later accused and acquitted of involvement in an organization called \"The Angry Brigade\" that carried out firebombings against targets such as the US Embassy in London. \r\n\r\nChristie was also a writer of a number of books related to anarchism. He was also an editor of the Soviet-era, English language version of the newsweekly Argumenty i Fakty (\"Arguments and Facts\") in London. This was a publication that disseminated Soviet propaganda during the final years of the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nMr. Christie's 2020 death was widely discussed in the mainstream media and on social media. Please take a look at an obituary from The Guardian newspaper, which should be attached to this request.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/17/stuart-christie-obituary\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Stuart Christie.\r\n\r\nAccording to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Stuart Christie.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Can you clarify if you are only requesting Use of Force incidents when an officer discharged their weapon/firearm or are you requesting all incidents when an officer discharged their weapon in the course of their duty, which would include euthanizing deer which falls outside of the Use of Force reporting and is a common occurrence in this Police Department?\r\n\r\nFor \"2\" and \"3\" the request for  \"Incident-level data\" and \"data\", are you requesting only the time, date, and street address (e.g. 123 Main St) for each specific incident? If not then \"Incident-level data\" and \"data\" needs to be specified on the data you are requesting, specifically identify the records sought, as required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(f).\r\n\r\nAny questions or concerns, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSergeant Michael Gallant\r\nRecords Bureau\r\nEdison Police Department\r\n100 Municiapl Blvd.\r\nEdison, NJ 08817\r\n(P) 732-248-7457\r\nhttps://www.edisonpolice.org/records-bureau/\r\n  [cid:image001.png@01D9615A.E53336B0]    [cid:image002.jpg@01D9615A.E53336B0]\r\n\r\nWARNING: Email received by or sent to Township officials is subject to the Open Public Records Act [OPRA].

For each incident I request to know the  time, date, and street address of each incident, as well as, if possible, the race, gender, and age of the officers and suspects/civilians involved in each incident, and the outcome of the shooting (ie., whether the shooting was fatal or not). \r\n\r\nBasically, I'm trying to know who (race, gender, age of suspects/civilians), when (date and time), and where (address) Edison police officers shot between the years 2000 and 2020, along with who (race, gender, age of police) did the shooting. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps narrow my request.\r\n\r\nMichael Owens",

The group gained notoriety in 2011/2012 for their blackhat hacking activities, which included attacks on the United Nations, NASA, NATO, Facebook and several other large corporations and government entities.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written about the government and its activities, with some\r\n    reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard,\r\n    Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I\r\n    have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing\r\n    skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files\r\n    online and make them available through non-profits such as the library\r\n    Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating\r\n    them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the\r\n    relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not\r\n    required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126\r\n    (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15\r\n    (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as\r\n    well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the\r\n    request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7\r\n    552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative\r\n    of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for\r\n    which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    \r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning TeaMp0isoN, computer security research group consisting of\r\n    3-5 core members. The group gained notoriety in 2011/2012 for their blackhat\r\n    hacking activities, which included attacks on the United Nations, NASA,\r\n    NATO, Facebook and several other large corporations and government entities.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

When you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201cfrom\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201cto\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201ccopied to\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\n1. You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n3. It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n#3 WHAT IS THE QUESTION? \"PLEASE CONSIDER SPECIFYING PARTICULAR RECORDS OF INTEREST?\"  I SEE NO QUESTION.\r\n\r\n4. I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n#4 WHAT IS THE QUESTION? AN \"INVATATION\" THAT I DISCLOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS RECORDS REQUEST THAT I HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE? I SEE NO QUESTION.\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\nI STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE ASKING. YOU HAVE THE EMAILS I SEND YOU AND I HAVE THE EMAILS YOU SEND ME. WHAT IS \"MISSING?\" AT THIS POINT PLEASE PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR MY OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH WHATEVER MORE YOU ARE REQUESTING OF ME.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\nYou state:\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 15 21 through 10 21 2021. It includes 227 messages. The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.

Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.

In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.

Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16th.  The District acknowledged the request on November 17th.  At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.  As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.  As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.  The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.  You requested the following public records:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.  The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.  I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.  This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.  The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request.\r\n\r\nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.  I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.  Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.  His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.  The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.  His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:HHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nThe District did have an SRO at Enterprise Middle School a number of years ago.  West Richland Office Nick Letourneau has not been assigned to the West Richland school for at least two years.  The District is researching the officer\u2019s date of departure.\r\n\r\nAgain, the District apologizes for the mistake and the delay in getting the responsive records to you. We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n RE: Public Records Request of November 16, 2022, Reference # R000183-120922 Good Morning: \nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16 th.\u00a0 The District acknowledged the request on November 17 th.\u00a0 At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.\u00a0 As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.\u00a0 As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.\u00a0 The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform. \nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.\u00a0 You requested the following public records: 1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order. \nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days. \nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.\u00a0 The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.\u00a0 I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.\u00a0 This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement. \nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.\u00a0 The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request. \nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years. \nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.\u00a0 I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days. \nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.\u00a0 Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.\u00a0 His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.\u00a0 The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.\u00a0 His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu. (mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu) \nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu. (mailto:HHSSecure@rsd.edu) \nThe District did have an SRO at Enterprise Middle School a number of years ago.\u00a0 West Richland Office Nick Letourneau has not been assigned to the West Richland school for at least two years.\u00a0 The District is researching the officer\u2019s date of departure. \nAgain, the District apologizes for the mistake and the delay in getting the responsive records to you. We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records. Richland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.\u00a0 The first installment to your public records request is now available.\u00a0 Please log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.
