        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI'm currently writing a book on the French ocean liner Normandie and having the information about the fire that destroyed the ship would be very important in NYC on Feb.9, 1942. The cause of the fire was deemed to be an accident despite many eyewitness accounts that it was sabotage.The initial report by the NYC Fire Marshal Thomas Brophy stated that the fire was caused by sabotage. But the day before the Marshal was going to release the report, he changed it to say that the fire was, in fact, an accident. Many people believe he was pressured by the FBI to accept the government version. I'm looking for the original Fire Marshal's report.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\ngeorge sucato",
