Mr. Linebarger was a writer of popular science-fiction and an expert in the field of psychological warfare. He was a professor at Duke University and Johns Hopkins University and an officer in the Army's psychological warfare section. After serving in World World II, he consulted with a number of government and intelligence agencies, including the Psychological Strategy Board and the Central Intelligence Agency, under his given name and wrote fiction under a pen name of Cordwainer Smith. His writing credits include Psychological Warfare (as Paul Linebarger) and Norstrilia (as Cordwainer Smith).\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Linebarger's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100.

If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2024-070821 to track the status of your request. \n\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations.

We are diligently working to process each request as quickly as possible, in the order they were received. We appreciate your patience during this time. \n \nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

You can view the electronically-submitted annual reports we have received here: https://sos.vermont.gov/vsara/file/municipal-reports/. That link also lists the annual reports that have been submitted to us in paper form.\r\n\r\nFor information about the articles put before the town voters identified in these annual town reports, as well as articles that were voted at special meetings of the town voters, I think you would need to contact each town directly.\r\n\r\nIn case it helps, here is some additional info about ratifying proposed amendments to the Vermont Constitution<https://sos.vermont.gov/vsara/learn/constitution/amending-the-constitution/> and other statewide referenda in Vermont<https://sos.vermont.gov/vsara/learn/general-assembly/referendum/>.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have further questions.\nBest regards,\r\nJenny Prosser\r\n\r\nJenny R.
