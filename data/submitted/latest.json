The program is described at https://www.regulations.doe.gov/certification-data/#q=Product_Group_s%3A*. Please release all historical records containing Brand Name, Product Group Code Description, Basic Model Number, and Individual Model Number Covered by the Basic Model produced since this program's inception.\r\n\r\n2) IDEA Project Data: Additionally, I am requesting any and all records related to the International Data Exchange on Appliance Efficiency (IDEA) project. This project, initially associated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the EnergyGuide labeling program, was reportedly integrated into the Department of Energy and may contain valuable historical model number data and other efficiency-related information. If possible, please provide records from both the FTC's and DOE's involvement with this project.\r\nThe program is described at the following URL: https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/lbnl-184403.pdf\r\n\r\nAs the FOIA requires, please release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents. If you withhold information or records then please identify the exemption through which you do so and advise me of my options for appeal under the law.\r\n\r\nFEES AND FEE STATUS\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. As a board member at The Repair Association, a nonprofit organization, I am engaged in academic and public education efforts through my Appliance Repair Accessibility project. The information requested will significantly contribute to the public's understanding of appliance repairability and access to repair content, topics of increasing relevance in our consumer and environmentally-conscious society. This aligns with the FOIA's objectives of promoting transparency and accountability in governmental practices related to appliance standards and regulations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by analyzing and disseminating the findings through our website, social media, and industry news partners, we aim to educate the public about the importance of repairability and sustainability in the appliance industry. This endeavor is not for commercial use but for the broader purpose of public education and advocacy in the field of repair rights and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as per Sack v. DOD (2016), I qualify for educational institution fee status and ask that you process my request accordingly. In your response, please confirm that you will be processing my request under the educational institution fee status.\r\n\r\nIf fees are assessed then I agree to pay fees up to $30 without additional notice. In the event that there are fees exceeding $30 then please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Zieminski",

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage. \n\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \n\nSincerely, \n\nBenjamin Cook \n\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmassachusetts-bay-transportation-authority-118%252Fsolar-canopies-for-parking-lots-154456%252F%253Femail%253DMassDOT.RAO%252540state.ma.us&url_auth_token=AAAd0Qofsajlg-3YJRiyf6tD6Ss%3A1r2Mdv%3Ay16qUM8dUkr_DmRd7Lb-yFMikohfitDEsfPHZMyjsYw\u201d \nOur Case No.: R001135-111223 \nDear Mr. Cook, \nThe MBTA is in receipt of your request for public records dated November 12, 2023 regarding the above-referenced matter; this request was received by our Records Access Officer on November 12, 2023. \nDue to the volume of documents that must be reviewed in order to provide you with a full response, I write to you to discuss how your request might be modified to provide for a more affordable and efficient response. See G.L. c. 66, \u00a710(b)(vii) (a records access officer may suggest a reasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the agency to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably). During our initial search, and in an attempt to comply with your request, it has been determined that based on your initial request the amount of records is beyond the basic purpose and intent of the public records law.\u00a0 \"A requester does not need absolute precision, but an agency is entitled to more than a general category of what may be thousands of documents.\" See The David Project, Inc. v. Boston Redevelopment Authority, 22 Mass.L.Rep. 361 (2007). Our preliminary search has generated over 169,000 emails, each of which would require individual review to delineate\u00a0the specific subject matter you are looking for. Under the Public Records Law \u201c[t]he reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d Jaideep Chawla v. Dep't of Revenue, Suffolk. Sup. No. 1784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019). \u201cRequests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently \u2018related\u2019 to the category of materials requested, will not satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d \nPlease reply at your earliest convenience to clarify, or assist in the modification of the scope of, your request so that we may more efficiently or affordably accommodate you. Absent an agreement to narrower terms, we anticipate that responding to this request may require a calculation and assessment of fees. We will await your response before doing any further work on this request. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. \nSincerely, \nRenee Lazaras Senior Legal Records Coordinator\n",

It is also quite good response time  and very helpful compared to other city and state agencies.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure how records are managed and indexed at NYC Office of the Actuary, but if you can provide any other reports like that that are responsive, that's an excellent start.\r\n\r\nIf the Office of the Actuary has other COVID related actuarial  reports and work products, like estimates of the financial burden and financial risk of a workforce with 1% new disability (thus forced into long term workers compensation/suing the city) from long COVID, the cost of death benefits from ongoing increased excess deaths, or studies of workforce disruption due to sickness, those too would be responsive.\r\n\r\nRegarding search terms like \"airborne transmission\", \"airborne disease\", and \"aerosol\", I have also heard rumors (that I will not specify) that other jurisdictions elsewhere in the world have performed actuarial analysis of the direct and liability costs of airborne diseases. At least one such institution may have weighed that in the past few years while choosing to publicly acknowledge the risk of airborne transmission, and decided to keep said information quiet in an attempt at reducing legal exposure. Thus, it would be curious and greatly effect the public if such analysis was done in our jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf records other than reports are available, such as emails and memos, I would appreciate their search and inclusion where possible.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
