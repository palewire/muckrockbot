Your request will be reviewed and the appropriate departments contacted to determine if disclosable records relevant to your request exist.\r\n\r\nAs required under California Code section 7922.535(a), the Los Angeles Unified School District (District) will make a determination within 10 days as to whether or not a request is seeking records that are publicly disclosable and, if so, to provide the estimated date that the records will be made available.  There is no requirement for a public agency to actually produce the records within 10 days of receiving a request, unless the requested records are readily available.  Still, the District prides itself on always providing all publicly disclosable records in as timely a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please contact the Office of the General Counsel at (213) 241-7600.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL.\n",
