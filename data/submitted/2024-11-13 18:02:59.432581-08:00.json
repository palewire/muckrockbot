It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1. Medicaid Billing Suspension and Sandata EVV Ticket #539494 (CMS and DSS)\r\nComprehensive Communications and Directives: Full records (emails, memos, reports, directives, attachments, text messages) from DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies concerning Medicaid billing privileges for ABI Resources, LLC, including names and roles of those involved in discussions and approvals.\r\n\r\nComplete Documentation of Sandata EVV Ticket #539494: All records associated with Ticket #539494, including:\r\n\r\nInitial ticket details, problem descriptions, resolution requests, and follow-ups.\r\nCommunications detailing each stage of the ticket\u2019s handling, the reason for marking it \u201cresolved,\u201d and personnel involved in closing it.\r\n2. Retaliatory Actions Following December 18, 2023, Whistleblower Report (DSS, CMS, DOJ, OSC)\r\nInternal and External Correspondence: All records, including emails, directives, text messages, memos, and meeting notes, discussing the whistleblower report filed on December 18, 2023, including responses, assessments, and any retaliatory actions considered or taken against ABI Resources.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of Investigative Actions: All documentation related to any investigations launched in response to the whistleblower complaint, identifying personnel involved, findings, and any recommendations or disciplinary actions.\r\n\r\n3. ADA Compliance Documentation and Accommodation Requests (OCR, DOJ, DSS, CMS)\r\nADA Accommodation Requests: All records concerning ADA accommodations requested by David Medeiros and ABI Resources, with full documentation of responses, denials, and any internal discussions on ADA compliance obligations.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance Policies and Internal Guidelines: Copies of internal policies, training materials, and guidelines used by DSS and CMS related to ADA compliance, particularly on communication accessibility and auxiliary aids for individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records on Program Changes Impacting ABI Resources (DSS, CMS)\r\nCompanion Authorizations Termination Records: All communications, policy documents, and assessments on the termination of companion authorizations for the ABI Waiver Program as of December 31, 2023, including any correspondence between DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies related to this decision.\r\n5. Documentation of Specific Individuals\u2019 Involvement (All Relevant Agencies)\r\nRecords Involving Named Personnel:\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves, Commissioner, DSS\r\nMatthew S. Antonetti, Legal Director, DSS\r\nAstread Ferron-Poole, DSS Associate\r\nMichelle A. James and Emmett Nicholson, CMS officials overseeing Medicaid compliance\r\nAll communications, directives, notes, meeting minutes, or any form of correspondence or records involving the above-named individuals with respect to ABI Resources, LLC, particularly regarding Medicaid billing restrictions, ADA accommodation requests, and actions following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for FOIA Request and Compliance Mandates\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).

This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.

FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance.

ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers.

These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards.

FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels.

It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1.

FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present.

FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1. Medicaid Billing Suspension and Sandata EVV Ticket #539494 (CMS and DSS)\r\nComprehensive Communications and Directives: Full records (emails, memos, reports, directives, attachments, text messages) from DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies concerning Medicaid billing privileges for ABI Resources, LLC, including names and roles of those involved in discussions and approvals.\r\n\r\nComplete Documentation of Sandata EVV Ticket #539494: All records associated with Ticket #539494, including:\r\n\r\nInitial ticket details, problem descriptions, resolution requests, and follow-ups.\r\nCommunications detailing each stage of the ticket\u2019s handling, the reason for marking it \u201cresolved,\u201d and personnel involved in closing it.\r\n2.

Records on Program Changes Impacting ABI Resources (DSS, CMS)\r\nCompanion Authorizations Termination Records: All communications, policy documents, and assessments on the termination of companion authorizations for the ABI Waiver Program as of December 31, 2023, including any correspondence between DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies related to this decision.\r\n5. Documentation of Specific Individuals\u2019 Involvement (All Relevant Agencies)\r\nRecords Involving Named Personnel:\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves, Commissioner, DSS\r\nMatthew S. Antonetti, Legal Director, DSS\r\nAstread Ferron-Poole, DSS Associate\r\nMichelle A. James and Emmett Nicholson, CMS officials overseeing Medicaid compliance\r\nAll communications, directives, notes, meeting minutes, or any form of correspondence or records involving the above-named individuals with respect to ABI Resources, LLC, particularly regarding Medicaid billing restrictions, ADA accommodation requests, and actions following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for FOIA Request and Compliance Mandates\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

This should include any references to journalists reporting on Leqembi by FDA agency staff whether or not the communication includes an employee of Eisai or Biogen.\"  \r\n\r\nSince my prior request is far more detailed, I'm asking for the biannual reports  separately as I believe this could be more rapidly fulfilled via an expedited request since the safety of lecanemab and associated deaths are currently a significant source of concern among many researchers and the press . I am therefore requesting expedited handling of this limited request. \r\n\r\nI am a professional journalist writing for The BMJ. \r\n \r\nAs an investigative journalist, I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this FOIA request and duplicating responsive records.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specifically this is a request for any presentations created for, or delivered to, members of the Presidential Transition Team for the new Administration (2nd Trump term) in November and December 2024. Please include any materials (documents, Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, audio/visual) from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (or \"PCAST\") which is under the umbrella of the Office of Science of Technology Policy. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is information related to pandemic planning or deliberations related to executive branch planning for the responses to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV, Monkeypox, COVID-19, West Nile virus, Coxsackie, H1N1, etc. \r\n\r\nAccording to several books and much media coverage, President Trump claimed at the outset of the COVID-19 that there was no nearly no documentation or planning shared during the 2016/2017 transition related to pandemic planning, while members of the Obama administration have publicly claimed that OSTP pandemic planning documents were ignored. Any documents related to the efficacy of the Biden administration's response to Monkeypox or Covid-19 or HIV would be of particular interest. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Office of Science and Technology Policy's commitment to transparency. The release of these documents would be of a great public benefit in understanding the pandemic and the public health challenges we face.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Specifically, this grant and sub-award are described on USASpending.gov:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nMy initial FOIA request was rejected with the following text: \"There are no records responsive to your request. There were no technical or research reports for this project.\" See IDA Letter 2025-00131-F. I am sending a copy of this IDA letter to DHA.FOIAappeals@health.mil , as requested in the said letter.\r\n\r\nI want to draw your attention to the fact that $750,000 were paid to Wayne State University by the DOD. This included a sub-award WSU23001 in the amount of  $218,562  to Michigan State University. Sub-award description found on the same USAspending.gov page is as follows:\r\n\r\n'IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #1, WE WILL EXPOSE GYRENCEPHALIC FERRETS (N = 48), WHICH ARE UNLIKE LISSENCEPHALIC ANIMALS (MICE AND RATS), TO RF WAVES FOR TWO HOURS/DAY FOR SIXTY DAYS USING A SOURCE \r\n OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EXPOSURE PROFILE THAT IS LIKELY COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL RECEIVED. SOME ADDITIONAL ANIMALS (N = 24) WILL RECEIVE SHAM EXPOSURE. IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN ANIMAL MODEL WITH THE BRAIN STRUCTURES RESEMBLING THE GYRENCEPHALIC NATURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN; MICE AND RATS DO NOT FULFIL THOSE CRITERIA.\r\n \r\n IN TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE #2, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER RF WAVE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, COCHLEAR, OR VESTIBULAR CHANGES AMONG THE FERRETS AFTER TWO MONTHS COMPARED TO SHAM \r\n EXPOSED ANIMALS.\r\n \r\nPROJECT MILESTONES\r\n OUR MILESTONES WILL BE: (1) FULL ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL AT TWO MONTHS; (2) TESTING OF RF WAVE GENERATOR/RECEIVERS BY THE FOURTH MONTH; (3) TESTING COHORTS OF FERRETS [8 FERRETS/MONTH] FOR RF WAVE EXPOSURE WITH BEHAVIORAL, RADIOGRAPHIC, HISTOPATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR ANALYSES BETWEEN FOUR AND \r\n TWELVE MONTHS; (4) FINAL DATA ANALYSES AT ONE YEAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement of rejection issued in the IDA Letter 2025-00131-F doesn't  conform with the information available on the USAspending.gov webpage describing Project Grant FAIN W81XWH2211105 and sub-award WSU23001:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2211105_2100\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",
