Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Acting Director, the prior head of ICE\u2019s Custody Management Division, and the agency\u2019s Acting Director during both the Trump and Biden Administrations, Tae Johnson is the single official with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by him about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving Johnon\u2019s emails for historians and experts to understand his response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "This is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I request all records related to Elmer Howard Maas, Jr., born 29 August 1935 in Kansas City, MO; died 8 May 2005, http://baltimorenonviolencecenter.blogspot.com/2009/05/remembering-elmer-maas-he-died-on.html. Mr. Maas was an anti-nuclear peace activist and a member of the \"Plowshares Eight,\" a group of nonviolent protesters who  staged an anti-nuclear protest at a General Electric plant on 9 September 1980.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of the Bureau's records on the following people, organizations, and events to see if they contain additional records regarding the subject:\r\n1. Plowshares Movement\r\n2. Plowshares Eight anti-nuclear protest of 9 September 1980\r\n3. Daniel Joseph Berrigan, born 9 May 1921 in Virginia, MN, USA; died 30 April 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/nyregion/daniel-j-berrigan-defiant-priest-who-preached-pacifism-dies-at-94.html\r\n4. Philip Francis Berrigan, born 5 October 1923 in Two Harbors, MN, USA; died 6 December 2002, https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/us/philip-berrigan-former-priest-peace-advocate-vietnam-war-era-dies-79.html\r\n5. Carl Kabat, born 10 October 1933 in Scheller, IL, USA; died 4 August 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/carl-kabat-dead.html\r\n6. Anne Montgomery, born 30 November 1926 in San Diego, CA, USA; died 27 August 2012, https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/sr-anne-montgomery-plowshares-leader-against-nuclear-weapons-dies\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction. If previously-released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Maas has died, meaning that the Bureau will now be able to release records that were not previously available publicly.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Maas was a public figure. His participation in the Plowshares Eight protest made him a subject of national and international attention. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records publicly available online for free via MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because records related to Mr. Maas are also contained in the files of the other members of the Plowshares Eight. Thus, those records can now be un-redacted as well.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: on balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.",

        "communication": "This is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. Please produce all records related to anti-nuclear protester and peace activist Rev. Carl Kabat (born 10 October 1933 in Scheller, IL, USA; died 4 August 2022). Kabat was a Roman Catholic priest and a member of the \"Plowshares Eight,\" a group of eight people who staged an anti-nuclear protest at a General Electric plant on 9 September 1980.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of the Bureau's records on the following people, organizations, and events to see if they contain additional records regarding the subject:\r\n1. Plowshares Movement \r\n2. Plowshares Eight anti-nuclear protest of 9 September 1980\r\n3. Daniel Joseph Berrigan, born 9 May 1921 in Virginia, MN, USA; died 30 April 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/nyregion/daniel-j-berrigan-defiant-priest-who-preached-pacifism-dies-at-94.html\r\n4. Philip Francis Berrigan, born 5 October 1923 in Two Harbors, MN, USA; died 6 December 2002, https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/us/philip-berrigan-former-priest-peace-advocate-vietnam-war-era-dies-79.html\r\n5. Elmer Howard Maas, Jr., born 29 August 1935 in Kansas City, MO; died 8 May 2005, http://baltimorenonviolencecenter.blogspot.com/2009/05/remembering-elmer-maas-he-died-on.html\r\n6. Anne Montgomery, born 30 November 1926 in San Diego, CA, USA; died 27 August 2012, https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/sr-anne-montgomery-plowshares-leader-against-nuclear-weapons-dies\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction. If previously-released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Rev. Kabat has recently died, meaning that the Bureau will now be able to release records that were not previously available publicly.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Rev. Kabat was a public figure. News obituaries for Rev. Kabat ran in the New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/carl-kabat-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2022/08/11/carl-kabat-nuclear-cleric-dies, among other places. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records publicly available online for free via MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Rev. Kabat has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now publicly release responsive records that it could not have released until now. It will also allow the Bureau to un-redact portions of other records already available on The Vault. For example, the files on The Vault related to Daniel Berrigan are filled with redactions related to Rev. Kabat. Those records can now be un-redacted, increasing the public's understanding even further.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: on balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to request information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, regarding the bandwidth usage and power consumption of the National Security Agency's (NSA) data centers. Specifically, I am requesting data on the gigawatt power consumption and bandwidth usage of the NSA's data centers listed below for the past three years:\r\n\r\nUtah Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah\r\nGeorgia Cryptologic Center in Augusta, Georgia\r\nTexas Cryptologic Center in San Antonio, Texas\r\nNSA Hawaii Cryptologic Center in Honolulu, Hawaii\r\n\r\nTo ensure a complete and thorough response, I would like to clarify that when I use the term \"any\" in my request, I am using it in the broadest sense to mean all records that meet the criteria specified in my request. I am not limiting my request to a specific type or subset of records, but rather seeking all records that contain the requested information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request that any responsive records be provided in a format that is accessible to individuals with disabilities, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Section 508 standards.\r\n\r\nWith that clarification, I request the following information:\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the power consumption of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of power consumed by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources of energy used (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewable sources) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all documents, including but not limited to reports, spreadsheets, or data tables, that contain information about the bandwidth usage of the above-listed NSA data centers, including:\r\n\r\na. The total amount of data transmitted and received by each data center on an annual basis for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nb. The sources and types of data transmitted and received (e.g., voice, text, images, video) for each data center for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nc. Any efforts or initiatives by the NSA to reduce bandwidth usage or improve network efficiency at each data center, including any plans or programs in place for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all correspondence, including emails and memos, between NSA officials and other federal agencies, contractors, or private companies, regarding the energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency of the above-listed NSA data centers, including any information related to the power consumption or bandwidth usage of these facilities.\r\n\r\nAny and all records, including but not limited to contracts or agreements, related to the procurement or purchase of energy or network equipment for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to the maintenance or repair of equipment or systems related to energy usage or efficiency or bandwidth usage or efficiency for the above-listed NSA data centers for each of the past three years.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that all responsive records are included, please conduct a search that includes all files, documents, and electronic data created or received by the NSA from January 1, 2018, to the date of your processing this FOIA request. If any responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please provide a detailed justification for each exemption and segregate any non-exempt portions for release.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to cite the following case law in support of this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nIn Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 923 F. Supp. 2d 237, 242-44 (D.D.C. 2013), the court held that energy usage data of government facilities was not protected by Exemption 3 or Exemption 4 of the FOIA and must be disclosed.\r\nIn Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 191 F. Supp. 2d41, 54 (D.D.C. 2002), the court held that a request for information on energy usage and efficiency of government facilities is not unduly burdensome and must be processed under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the use of a Glomar response, I would like to state that the existence of responsive records is not classified or exempt from disclosure under FOIA. I am requesting information that is not classified or sensitive in nature, and the release of which would not harm national security or any ongoing investigation or operation.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request any and all internal directives or policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) regarding EOIR\u2019s process for contracting out, obtaining, and reviewing transcripts of hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ) for review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), as required by the BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.2(f). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request any current internal directives, manuals, memos, policy guidance, or other documents related to:  \r\n1.\tProcesses and procedures for assigning Digital Audio Recording(s) (\u201cDAR\u201d) to transcription contractors, including but not limited to Free State Reporting, Inc. (\u201cFree State\u201d), to be transcribed for purposes of creating the Record of Proceeding(s) (\u201cROP\u201d) for review by the BIA (see attached document for previous guidance, last updated in 2015)\r\n2.\tAny training, education, or certification EOIR requires of transcribers or the transcription companies with which EOIR contracts;\r\n3.\tAny policies and guidance regarding EOIR oversight and quality control over the transcription process, including any quality control checklists used by EOIR staff; \r\n4.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR takes when the transcription contractor sends back a defective or otherwise unsatisfactory transcript, for example one with significant typos, indiscernible notations, or other errors, including any processes for returning a defective or unsatisfactory transcript to the transcription contractor to be re-transcribed;\r\n5.\tAny policies and procedures regarding the steps EOIR and/or the transcription contractor takes when the DAR is partially or totally inaudible such that it cannot be properly transcribed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that EOIR waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding how and when immigration proceedings are transcribed for appellate purposes. CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations\u2014representing non-citizens before EOIR.  As a provider of legal services to non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients.\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is currently briefing a Petition for Review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in which defects in the transcript present a central issue on appeal. Information about the transcription process will help CAIR Coalition articulate legal arguments about our client's due process right to meaningful appellate review and advocate for broadly applicable law and procedures to be employed when a defective transcript is hindering review. Petitioner's opening brief to the Fourth Circuit is due on June 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",

The Supreme Court has recognized that FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" (New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971) and that the government has a \"heavy burden\" to prove that information should be kept secret (id.). FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the government has the burden of proving that the information requested is exempt from disclosure (United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 1989).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is as comprehensive as possible, I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nFlight Logs: Please provide all records related to the helicopter flight, including but not limited to flight logs that detail the flight paths and actions taken during the flight. These records should include information about the time of takeoff and landing, the duration of the flight, and any stops made during the flight.\r\nVideo Logs: Please provide all video logs captured by the helicopter's onboard cameras during the flight. These logs should include all footage captured during the flight, including footage of any stops made during the flight.\r\nTransmissions: Please provide all records of transmissions between the helicopter and ground personnel or any other parties during the flight. These records should include any audio recordings or written transcripts of these transmissions.\r\nMaintenance and Safety Records: Please provide any records related to the helicopter's maintenance and safety inspections, as well as the pilot's certifications and qualifications.\r\nWeather and Air Traffic Information: Please provide all weather and air traffic information that was available to the pilot during the flight.\r\nPilot Logbook: Please provide the pilot's logbook for the flight, which should include the pilot's flight hours, certifications, and qualifications.\r\nFlight Plan: Please provide the flight plan for the helicopter flight, including any revisions made to the plan before or during the flight.\r\nCommunications between DEP and Other Agencies: Please provide any records of communications between the DEP and other agencies related to the helicopter flight.\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: Please provide any body-worn camera footage that was recorded by DEP personnel during the flight, if available.\r\nRecords of Stops or Interactions: Please provide any records related to any stops or interactions that occurred during the flight, including but not limited to any reports or logs of interactions with members of the public or other agencies.\r\nThe courts have held that agencies must conduct a \"reasonable search\" for records responsive to a FOIA request, and that the adequacy of an agency's search is to be judged by the reasonableness of the efforts made, not by the results achieved (Electronic Privacy Information Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security, 2006). I would like to request that these records be provided to me in an electronic format, if possible, to reduce the cost and time associated with printing and mailing.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of these records is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, please provide an explanation of the basis for the exemption, consistent with the courts' holding that FOIA's exemptions are to be narrowly construed and that the government has the burden of proving that information should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

(Please explain how this specific information assists the public given the information already provided to the public on this topic);\r\n\r\nWe believe there is a strong public interest in reporting these matters, not least because Shotspotter/SoundThinking is a rapidly growing policing technology company on which hundreds of police departments rely and the company is working actively to secure a contract with the Portland Police Bureau. Because this is a public procurement process, the public has a strong interest in full transparency into this process and conversations that are happening between public officials such as the police and any vendors they are considering working with. \r\n\r\n3) How do you or your organization intend to disseminate the information to the wider public?\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the documents we will determine if they warrant coverage through some sort of journalistic work including but not limited to written articles, podcasts, or videos. \r\n\r\n",

This includes not only the cases initiated by the university or individual students but also any related court cases that support the premise that such information should be released under FOIA, such as case law establishing or affirming the public's right to access this type of information.\r\nPolicy Changes: Any revisions or amendments made to the university's policies, guidelines, or procedures concerning sexual misconduct over the last five years in response to these incidents.\r\nAs allowed under the New York State Freedom of Information Law, I request that these documents be produced on a rolling basis, meaning as they become available.

Please find the amended request below:\r\n\r\nI am requesting copies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) case files 105-HQ-83543 and 123-HQ-15685. A prior Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request, 1547783-000, was sent to the FBI for records on Christopher Bird (May 11, 1928-May 2, 1996), and the Bureau responded by identifying the aforementioned case file numbers as potentially responsive to the request and stating all subsequent records had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Further, it recommended the filing of a FOIPA request through NARA's Special Access and Freedom of Information Act Program. Therefore, I am sending this request for access to FBI case files 105-HQ-83543 and 123-HQ-15685.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Bird is identified in these records, there is no expectation of a violation of his privacy, as he passed away in 1996. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Bird's obituary, published in The New York Times on May 06, 1996.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords of the number of transfers conducted by DOCCS in 2020 and 2021. I understand that this information might be collected in different ways and have outlined specific requests in relation to what I anticipate might be possible below. If none of the below is possible or if records pertinent to prison transfers (i.e., movements) are collected/saved in a way that I have not captured, please contact me with more information. I am flexible and can modify my request to be responsive to the records that exist.\r\n\r\nREQUEST: \r\nI request information on movements/transfers between DOCCS facilities conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This would include any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility\u201d as listed on DOCCS's \"Incarcerated Lookup,\" for example. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. This would not include movements such as: a temporary transfer to a hospital for a medical procedure; a temporary transfer to court for a court appointment; or a one-night or few-hour \u201cstop-over\u201d at a DOCCS facility on the way to another facility. \r\n\r\nIf movements/transfers are recorded in such a way as to distinguish movements that result in changes in housing facility from temporary movements, then I request records of every inter-facility, non-temporary (as described above) transfer made in 2020 and 2021. For each, I request the following insofar as is possible: \r\n\r\na)\tThe name of the sending facility \r\nb)\tThe name of the receiving facility\r\nc)\tThe date of the transfer\r\nd)\tThe reason for transfer \r\ne)\tAny transfer considerations, as recorded/described\r\nf)\tAny additional explanation of the causes for transfer, as recorded/described\r\ng)\tUnique identifier for each person transferred, if possible \r\n\r\nCONTINGENCIES: \r\nIf transfers are not disaggregated between temporary movements and non-temporary movements, then I request the above information for all movements. \r\n\r\nHowever these records are available is acceptable, with the priority being records that include the information listed above (including if this means requesting multiple types of records). \r\n\r\nFor example, if the information above is available in a summary table organized by day, week, month, or another unit of time, I request that summary table. Or, if it is available as redacted versions of transfer forms for each transfer, then I request those forms (such as form 8.6, \u201cTransfer Referral,\u201d KITSM86; or form 4.5.1 \u201cTransfer Review,\u201d KGNCM4B). In other words, I\u2019m flexible with what is available based on DOCCS record-making and record-keeping systems. If the above is impossible, please contact me to discuss what is available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Because your FOIA request is for records\r\nthat may be archival records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2RR) staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\ntextual archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly\r\nto you.

A partial list of Example Submissions, Demonstrations and EPA responses prepared under the 2016 Exceptional Events Rule has been publicly posted by the EPA here: https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/example-demonstrations-and-epa-responses-prepared-under-2016-exceptional\r\n\r\nDocument Request\r\n\r\nWe seek copies of the following records submitted to and prepared by the EPA Regional Office between September 30, 2016, through May 08, 2023:\r\n\r\n1. All initial notification packages created by state, local, or tribal agencies now held by the EPA Regional Office. By this language, we intend to include emails or any other records of communication containing, for example, the potential date of event, relevant criteria pollutant, location, and potential regulatory decision affected (such as designation, classification, attainment determination, attainment date extension, or finding of SIP inadequacy leading to SIP call). An example of an Initial Notification Summary for PM2.5 from EPA Region 9 has been attached to this request.\r\n2. Any acknowledgement or response from EPA to initial notifications or notification packages, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14 (Table 2).\r\n3. All submissions of demonstrations of exceptional events related to criteria pollutants, as submitted by state, local, or federal authorities.\r\n4. All subsequent responses and decisions communicated by the EPA, including approvals, denials or requests for more information, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14.\r\n\r\nWe request that all of these records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B)\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the Brown Institute, MuckRock, or California Newsroom\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the regulation of air pollution, which is harmful to human health. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a nonprofit organization assisting other news media organizations on coverage of federal government policy, we have demonstrated our \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees\r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2).\r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. Over the last several years, wildfires have grown, and with them, so has pollution from particulate matter and ozone. Climate change is a significant factor in the understanding of five of the six criteria pollutants, and understanding how criteria pollution overall is excepted is crucial to public understanding of the management of health risks. The information requested thus concerns \u201ca matter of exigency to the American public\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest.\u201d Bloomberg, L.P. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the EPA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the EPA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what we are seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address below. Pursuant to the applicable FOIA provision and departmental regulations, we expect a response regarding this request within the ten (10) working day time limit set by law. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.27(c); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrown Institute, MuckRock, and California Newsroom\r\n\u2105 Brown Institute for Media Innovation\r\n2950 Broadway\r\nNew York NY 10027\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "The FOIA request EPA-2023-004149 has had its Tracking Number changed to EPA-R1-2023-004149.  This is normally due to the request being transferred to another agency (for example, EPA to Dept. of Commerce) or to a sub-agency to process it. Additional details for this request are as follows: \r\n \r\n  * Old Tracking Number:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEPA-2023-004149 \r\n  * New Tracking Number:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEPA-R1-2023-004149 \r\n  * Requester Name:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDillon Bergin \r\n  * Date Submitted:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t05/09/2023 \r\n  * Long Description:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nThis is an expedited request by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, MuckRock, and the California Newsroom (\u201cBrown Institute,\u201d\u201cMuckRock,\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Newsroom\u201d) under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, for all submitted, denied and confirmed exceptional events related to criteria pollutants in EPA Region 1. A partial list of Example Submissions, Demonstrations and EPA responses prepared under the 2016 Exceptional Events Rule has been publicly posted by the EPA here: https://www.epa.gov/air-quality-analysis/example-demonstrations-and-epa-responses-prepared-under-2016-exceptional \r\n\r\nDocument Request \r\n\r\nWe seek copies of the following records submitted to and prepared by the EPA Regional Office between September 30, 2016, through May 08, 2023: \r\n\r\n1. All initial notification packages created by state, local, or tribal agencies now held by the EPA Regional Office. By this language, we intend to include emails or any other records of communication containing, for example, the potential date of event, relevant criteria pollutant, location, and potential regulatory decision affected (such as designation, classification, attainment determination, attainment date extension, or finding of SIP inadequacy leading to SIP call). An example of an Initial Notification Summary for PM2.5 from EPA Region 9 has been attached to this request. \r\n2. Any acknowledgement or response from EPA to initial notifications or notification packages, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14 (Table 2). \r\n3. All submissions of demonstrations of exceptional events related to criteria pollutants, as submitted by state, local, or federal authorities. \r\n4. All subsequent responses and decisions communicated by the EPA, including approvals, denials or requests for more information, as described in 40 C.F.R. 50.14. \r\n\r\nWe request that all of these records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B) \r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request \r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the Brown Institute, MuckRock, or California Newsroom\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii). \r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest \r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the regulation of air pollution, which is harmful to human health. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a nonprofit organization assisting other news media organizations on coverage of federal government policy, we have demonstrated our \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii). \r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees \r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees. \r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing \r\n\r\nWe also ask that the information requested be disclosed on an expedited basis. Expedited processing is appropriate here because a \u201ccompelling need\u201d exists for disclosure of the requested information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public, there is \u201can urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a75.27(b)(2). \r\n\r\nAs a news organization, we are primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. Over the last several years, wildfires have grown, and with them, so has pollution from particulate matter and ozone. Climate change is a significant factor in the understanding of five of the six criteria pollutants, and understanding how criteria pollution overall is excepted is crucial to public understanding of the management of health risks. The information requested thus concerns \u201ca matter of exigency to the American public\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest.\u201d Bloomberg, L.P. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). \r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the EPA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the EPA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. \r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what we are seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address below. Pursuant to the applicable FOIA provision and departmental regulations, we expect a response regarding this request within the ten (10) working day time limit set by law. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.27(c); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I). \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nBrown Institute, MuckRock, and California Newsroom \r\n\u2105 Brown Institute for Media Innovation \r\n2950 Broadway \r\nNew York NY 10027 \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
