Barescu. According to the documents publicly available at present time, John S. Barescu was suspected of being a KGB agent in the early 1960s.     \r\n\r\nFOIA case law establishes the extent to which agencies MUST search all records systems reasonably believed to contain responsive documents, even if it means contacting former employees. The Justice Department's May 2004 Guide states that an agency \"cannot limit its search to only one record system if there are others that are likely to turn up the information requested.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFilip Kovacevic",
