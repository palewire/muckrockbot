This investigation is known to have used mail covers. The following file numbers are associated with Penetrate: 65-HQ-67842, 65-SJ-398, 65-MM-2940. The HQ file number is also cited in previously released records on MIRA, which potentially identify Penetrate as Filiberto Inocencio Ojeda-Rios, the subject of a 1970 fugitive case (https://archive.org/details/MovimentoIndependentistaRevolucionarioEnArmas/SJ-100-12315_4_04_70/page/n75/mode/2up).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDescription of Records Sought: \r\n1. All records constituting a Corrective Action Plan created for the ICE Otay Mesa Detention Center (OMDC) in response to the findings and recommendations of the ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) Mortality Review Committee's May 12, 2023, Mortality Review of the death of Cristian Dumitrascu on March 5, 2023, inside OMDC. OMDC is located within the San Diego ERO Area of Responsibility. A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review obtained via ICE FOIA 2024-ICFO-28664 is publicly available here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25472204-dumitrascu-mortality-review-2024-icfo-28664-001/. \r\n\r\n2. A record, if any, reflecting ICE's determination not to impose a corrective action plan in response to the IHSC Mortality Review Committee's findings and recommendations. \r\n\r\n3. Any Contract Discrepancy Report and relating correspondence between ICE and CoreCivic reflecting a deduction or withholding of invoiced funds by ICE based on the findings of IHSC's Mortality Review Committee that Core Civic staff fell short of contractually required standards in Mr. Dumitrascu's care and the associated facility response.\r\n\r\nSuggested Search Parameters, Time Period, Custodians, and Methodology\r\nPlease task a search that includes Mr. Dumitrascu's name and Alien registration, A246 302 355 as case numbers associated with the Mortality Review.\r\nAn adequate search should cover a date range commencing on or before May 12, 2023, and continuing through the date on which the agency tasks an adequate search responsive to this request. \r\nCustodians to task with this search include, but are not limited to, Stewart D. Smith, Ada I. Rivera, the IHSC Chief of Staff, and the IHSC Chief of the Investigations Unit, as well as ICE OAQ, the ICE ERO SDO Field Office Director, the ICE Chief of Staff, the Acting ICE Director, the Director of Custody Management, and the Deputy Assistant Director of Health Care Compliance. \r\nPlease process the results of this search by first locating the following responsive records: (a) Corrective Action Plan; (2) Contract Discrepancy Report; (3) associated communications. These documents, once located, will provide additional, obvious leads that will yield responsive records as to the remainder of the request. \r\n\r\nRequestors\r\nI make this request on behalf of the Mami Chelo Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization located in New York, New York. Mami Chelo holds power of attorney for Mr. Dumitrascu's Next-of-Kin, in addition to serving as a resource for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated migrants and refugees. I also seek these records on my own behalf as an independent, freelance journalist and a member of the media primarily engaged in the dissemination of information. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request and Sworn Statement \r\nMami Chelo respectfully requests expedited processing based on an urgent need to inform the public about actual or alleged government misconduct, and based on 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), because preventable deaths in ICE custody constitute a matter of widespread media attention about which there exist questions as to the propriety and legality of the government's actions. In support of this expedited processing request, I make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 and affirm that they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in the dissemination of information.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public about the circumstances of Mr. Dumitrascu's death.\r\n3. At least 7 people detained in the same area as Mr. Dumitrascu declared under oath that his care was delayed by CoreCivic staff.\r\n4. Multiple individuals detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death declared under oath that CoreCivic shut off telephone lines in the hours following his death -- preventing them from communicating what happened.\r\n5. At least one person detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death alleged CoreCivic and ICE accelerated the process of his removal in retaliation for attempting to share information about the death.\r\n6. CoreCivic facilities have previously been fined for negligence and contract violations that preceded deaths in ICE custody. See, e.g., https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24529304-stewart-contract-discrepancy-dec-2018.\r\n7. At least 55 deaths have occurred at CoreCivic's ICE facilities since 2003--more than any other ICE contractor.\r\n8. Since early 2017, ICE ceased affirmatively publishing detainee death reviews, forcing families to file FOIAs and sue when their loved ones die in order to obtain basic information on the government's findings.\r\n9. Congress recently approved the expansion of ICE detention by more than 20% -- up 7,500 beds to 41,500 funded.\r\n10. DHS and the present administration proposed cuts to inspection budgets for ICE detention centers, rendering the public less able to assess the lethality of ICE detention operations, including those at Otay Mesa.\r\n11. The IHSC Mortality Review ICE completed on May 12, 2023, concluded Mr. Dumitrascu received deficient emergency medical care. \r\n12. ICE is currently poised to award additional contract to the care provider -- CoreCivic -- despite its documented history of being the most lethal detention contract in the ICE detention system. \r\n13. We will make these records immediately available to the public and intend to publish a report based on them. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Over 92,000 cryptocurrency SARs were filed in 2021 reflecting transactions worth over\r\n$96 billion dollars.\r\n\r\n2: When adjusted for percentage of U.S adults using a given financial product, crypto SAR filings dwarf SARs filed relating to investment products and are gaining ground on\r\nU.S currency SARs. For example, there were 2.74 SARs per 1,000 Users of Crypto versus 0.18 SARS per 1,000 Users of Stock.\r\n\r\n3: The dollar value of each cryptocurrency SAR hovers near $1 million dollars which is significantly greater than the dollar value of other products and industries.\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting to be informed of the number of cryptocurrency related SARs that have led to final convictions in the year 2021 as a matter of public interest. Please note that I am not requesting to be notified of the attribution or contents of SARs, waving any possible national security concerns.\r\n\r\nIn case this number has already been made available to the public, please point me toward where I can find it.\r\n\r\nAs an independent journalist, I ask that any fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
