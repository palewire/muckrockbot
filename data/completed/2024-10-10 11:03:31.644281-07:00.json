Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, job title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, parish, hire date, termination date, civil service status, annual salary, and gross wages. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

There are also 117 originally-digital electronic files to be provided electronically, resulting in copying costs of $ 1.46. The data delivery file of 0.052321 gigabytes has negligible fees. The total cost of this records request is $10.16\r\n\r\n You paid $16 as the estimated cost of which $5.84 is due back to you, where would you like your refund check sent and whom should it be made out too? \r\n\r\nThis completes KCDA\u2019s response to your request dated June 24, 2024. KCDA has closed your request and no additional records will be produced in response to this request. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request.

Please find the first batch of non-exempt records responsive to your requests enclosed.\r\n\r\nResponsive documents pursuant to your request will not be produced and/or will be redacted based on the following:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confidential information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine. Government Code Section 7927.705 and Evidence Code Section 950 et seq.\r\n\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Records, the disclosure of which are exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law. Government Code Section 7927.705.\r\n\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Records exempt because the public interest in withholding the records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the records. Government Code Section 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur review of records continues, and we anticipate releasing a second batch of non-exempt records responsive to your request on or before September 4, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at County of Marin, CA.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Please task a search for the budget cycles covering fiscal years (FY) 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. \r\n\r\n2. Any record showing requested budget increases for DHS, ICE, CBP, OIG or USCIS FOIA offices that were not fulfilled by Congress in the appropriations legislation for FY19-22. \r\n\r\n3. Any record showing the amount of additional appropriated funds estimated to be necessary to reduce the current backlogs, shorten processing times, and avoid costly litigation involving FOIA processing by CBP, ICE, OIG, DHS, and USCIS during FY19-23. \r\n\r\n4. Any record of DHS acknowledging, approving, or directing its agency subcomponents\u2019 FOIA offices (ICE, OIG, CBP, USCIS, or DHS) to \u201cprocess\u201d only  500 pages of records per month in litigation.\r\n\r\n5. Any record showing DHS agency subcomponents\u2019 FOIA Office determinations that they  lack adequate resources to fulfill their statutory timing obligations were communicated by those agencies to DHS leadership and budgeting personnel. The subcomponents to be queried are iCE, CBP, OIG, USCIS, and DHS HQ.  Please query FY19-23.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I further appeal  the agency\u2019s failure to categorize this \u201ctoo-broad\u201d determination as a denial and notify me of my right to appeal. And I appeal the agency\u2019s failure to task an adequate search in response to this request. \r\n\r\n6 CFR Section 5.3(b) provides: \r\n\r\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component's filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Requesters should refer to appendix I of this subpart for additional component-specific requirements. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component's FOIA Officer or FOIA public liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request, a component determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the component should inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the DHS Privacy Office, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.\r\n\r\nI am searching in vain to find any contact information you provided in your April 22, 2022, that would allow me, as a requestor, to \u201cdiscuss [my] request with the component\u2019s designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the DHS FOIA Privacy Office, each of whom is available to assist [me] in reasonably describing the records sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nDHS has offered no contact information in this letter for its Designated FOIA Officer, its FOIA Public Liaison, or a \u201crepresentative of the DHS FOIA Privacy Office,\u201d and as such, none of them are \u201cavailable to assist\u201d as your own regulations require. \r\n\r\nPlease promptly remand this appeal with instructions to comply with the Department\u2019s own FOIA regulations and the Act. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to a cartoonist and web designer named Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Richards (born October 20th, 1946 - died April 21st, 2023) was a cartoonist in the 1960s and 70s. His work was frequently featured in publications such as The Berkeley Tribe. His death was widely reported, and a news report regarding his passing should be attached, and can be viewed at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2023/04/24/ted-richards-rip/\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the Cartoonist Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a thorough search for any records on Richards held by the Cincinnati, San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Theodore Stanley \"Ted\" Richards. Please note, there appears to have been a previous FOIA request with the bureau for records related to The Berkeley Tribe (FOIA: 1394913-0). Much of that file, which is currently accessible on the Internet Archive, appears to be heavily redacted. Please re-examine The Berkeley Tribe release in relation to the release of documents related to Theodore Richards. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the work that the bureau does, and for the bureau's commitment to transparency. I look forward to the resolution of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nThis message is in regard to a FOIA request you sent to our office on July 15, 2024.  You requested \"every letter Jennifer Gonzalez Colon or her office has sent to USACE's Jacksonville District.\"  \r\n\r\nThere is something that must be addressed before the Jacksonville District can begin the search for the records you have requested. Your request for is considered impermissibly broad and does not comply with the FOIA's requirement that requests for records reasonably describe the records you are seeking. Your request, as written, would not allow professional agency employees familiar with the subject area to locate the records with a \u201creasonable amount of effort.\u201d  It is the requester\u2019s responsibility to identify the records they seek, and the records must be described in a manner that enables our record holders to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore, it is most helpful to us if a requester provides very specific, descriptive information about the records they seek. All of the records related to a Corps project are not maintained in a single file or location. Each office/department maintains its own records based on the issues or matters for which it is involved.  Additionally, present archival systems do not allow us to ensure an adequate search for records using such broad criteria. Therefore, for us to locate all \"every letter Jennifer Gonzalez Colon or her office has sent to USACE's Jacksonville District\" as instructed in your request, we would have to request that every employee within the Jacksonville District search all of their electronic and hard copy records located within their purview to see if they have records that relate in any way possible to your request. This type of extensive search would involve many employees and would involve many hours of search time.  Please provide more specific information so that a reasonable search for records can be done.  Our office will not be able to assist you with your request until you narrow the scope of what you are seeking.\r\n\r\nWe will keep this matter in a pending status, but if we don't receive an amended request by August 8, 2024, we will close the file and take no further action.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFOIA ADMINISTRATOR\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District\r\n701 San Marco Blvd.\r\nJacksonville, FL 32207-8175\r\nph:  904-232-2477\r\n\r\nATTENTION:  PLEASE CONTACT OUR OFFICE DIRECTLY BY E-MAIL AT FOIA-SAJ@USACE.ARMY.MIL WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. TO ENSURE YOUR REQUEST IS RECEIVED AND PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FOIA REQUESTS BE E-MAILED TO OUR OFFICE AT FOIA-SAJ@USACE.ARMY.MIL.\n",

This preliminary estimate takes into account, among other things, the need to locate and assemble the record(s) requested, notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, and determine whether any record(s) must be redacted in whole or in part. This estimate also takes into account the number of public records requests currently being processed. In the event that we require additional time in which to respond, we will notify you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Sheriff's Office reserves the right to utilize an installment methodology in responding to your requests. This methodology is authorized pursuant to RCW 42.56.080. In the event that we elect to utilize an installment methodology, then the above noted estimate should be interpreted as applying to the production of a first installment of records and not interpreted as the estimated date by which we will have completed processing the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that Pursuant Clallam County Policy 321.17, fees for records requests shall be waived when the total fee for the request is under ten dollars. After a request has reached $10, an invoice will be generated for records released previously along with the current installment.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo request 911 Dispatcher records, please contact PenCom directly by emailing pencom@cityofpa.us or by calling (360) 452-4545.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Sheriff's Office by responding to this message or by using the contact information below.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAubree Johnson\r\n\r\nPublic Records Deputy\r\n\r\nClallam County Sheriff\u2019s Office\r\n\r\nPhone: (360) 504-1262\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Clallam County WA.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

I have attached a list of DHS film and TV collaborations obtained by another researcher to show that DHS supported this production. I request any and all documents pertaining to DHS support for \"Into the Wild.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the DHS and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Into the Wild,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

        "communication": "08/12/2024 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR136588 \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2024-ICAP-00127 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Appeal on remand. You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.  Thank you for your patience as we work to complete the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nFantasia Hogan-Bassey-Graham\r\nIBSS Corp.

The FBI and OIG both made FOIA productions about their spending for travel into the Silver State of Nevada.  The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/",

On the same day, Mr. Hodges responded stating that the statute only covers field sobriety\u00a0videos. It does not exempt the remaining parts of the incident (booking, transport, search, etc).\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 2021, Mr. Prince responded to this correspondence\u00a0and then stated that the\u00a0department was withholding the records because of an active criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nStatement of Appeal and Relief Requested:\r\n\r\nI appeal the action of Mr. Prince for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nReason #1:\r\n\r\nKRS 189A.100 only exempts\u00a0field sobriety\u00a0videos and not other parts of the video. Pursuant\u00a0to KRS 61.878(4), the agency is required to provide other parts of a record, even if one part is exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #1:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department violated the law when they refused to produce the\u00a0redacted video which does not contain the exempt information. The agency is required to\u00a0produce these records pursuant to KRS 61.878(4).\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\n\r\nKRS 61.878(1)(h) only exempts criminal records that would \"harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants not otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\". The agency has not presented evidence to show that there are any informants for this case or if the release of the video would harm the agency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the records are not exempt from the other part of the statute because the law enforcement action at hand is not prospective because the charges have already been filed against the defendant. This statute does not exempt documents regarding an active court case.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #2:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department has no right to withhold the information requested under this statute\u00a0because they have not presented sufficient evidence to show that the records are part of a \"prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\".\r\n\r\nI additionally request that you find the department violated\u00a0the law when they refused to produce the redacted video.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, I retain all rights to pursue litigation against the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.\r\n\r\nRespectfully\u00a0Submitted,\r\nMr. Hayden Hodges\r\n\r\nCC: Mr. Jeremy Prince (w/o enclosures)\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n1 -- Communication Regarding Record Request\r\n2 -- Police Report Regarding Incident",

The agency is required to produce these records pursuant to KRS 61.878(4).\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\n\r\nKRS 61.878(1)(h) only exempts criminal records that would \"harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants not otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\". The agency has not presented evidence to show that there are any informants for this case or if the release of the video would harm the agency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the records are not exempt from the other part of the statute because the law enforcement action at hand is not prospective because the charges have already been filed against the defendant. This statute does not exempt documents regarding an active court case.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #2:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department has no right to withhold the information requested under this statute because they have not presented sufficient evidence to show that the records are part of a \"prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\".\r\n\r\nI additionally request that you find the department violated the law when they refused to produce the redacted video.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, I retain all rights to pursue litigation against the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.\r\n\r\nRespectfully Submitted,\r\nMr. Hayden Hodges\r\n\r\nCC: Mr. Jeremy Prince (w/o enclosures)\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n1 -- Communication Regarding Record Request\r\n2 -- Police Report Regarding Incident",
