This system assists analysts in providing timely handling of security incidents as well as the ability to conduct improved analysis. I am requesting the records for every incident submitted to CISA through their Incident Reporting System submitted from January 1, 2020 until today\u2019s date. These records should include but are not limited to an Incident ID, Incident Description, Date, Organizational Details ( including but not limited to a Name of Org ). \r\n\r\nAlong with the above incident reports, I also am requesting any malware artifacts submitted to the Department of Homeland Security under the \"US-CERT AMAC Malware Analysis Submissions\" form ( https://www.malware.us-cert.gov/ ) since January 1 2020. These records should include any file submissions as well as the aforementioned form fields.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I would prefer that these records be provided in a machine-readable format such as a PDF, CSV or Excel file, and transferred electronically. If you cannot transfer the requested records electronically to my email, then please send them on a CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
