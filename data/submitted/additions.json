        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis is a Document Request by Jeanne Lenzer under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, for the following records:\r\n\r\nAll financial disclosure forms (Form FDA 3410 and/or Form OGE 450) for each voting FDA advisory committee member for the June 10, 2024 PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DRUGS ADVISORY COMMITTEE to review donanemab. I have copies of the two waivers granted but I am requesting the forms for each voting committee member.\r\nThe 11 voting members are:\r\n1.\tThomas Montine\r\n2.\tMerit Cudkowicz\r\n3.\tTanya (Tatyana) Simuni\r\n4.\tCynthia Carlsson\r\n5.\tNilufer Erteken-Taner\r\n6.\tCostantino Iadecola\r\n7.\tKathleen Poston\r\n8.\tDaniel Press\r\n9.\tDean Follman\r\n10.\tSara Dolan\r\n11.\tColette Johnston\r\n\r\n\tI request that all records be produced in their native electronic formats with any attached metadata included, so long as such electronic files can be opened using standard commercially available software. If the files cannot be produced in this manner, we request that records be produced in an alternative electronic format that is text-searchable.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B)\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in the requestor\u2019s commercial interest, 45 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nDisclosure Is in the Public Interest\r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the U.S. government\u2019s review process for the drug donanemab (Kisunla).  45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(1). In particular, the requested information will shed light on exceptional events, a mechanism used by regulators to account for and exclude air pollution, information which is not \u201calready in the public domain.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(i). As a peer-reviewed medical journal, The BMJ has demonstrated its \u201cability and intention to effectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).  I am an independent professional journalist writing for The BMJ, a global medical journal. \r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees\r\n\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are a member of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are \u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nAs a medical journal with an investigative news section, The BMJ is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public.  The approval of donanemab to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, has profound effects on the treatment and potential adverse health effects of more than a million people in the US, and many more internationally.  \r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31.  An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). We therefore request that if the FDA determines that an exemption applies that it also provide specific reasons why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the FDA release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you have any questions or concerns about what I am seeking, please do not hesitate to contact us at the email address and/or phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJeanne Lenzer\r\nIndependent medical investigative journalist\r\nThe BMJ\r\n19 Ridge St., Kingston, NY  12401\r\njeanne.lenzer@gmail.com\r\n845.399.0405\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer",
