I find it very concerning that several Class IV Establishments have yet to be renewed over 6 months after prior permit expired. One of  which is a daycare that services a vulnerable population. \r\nPublic Health Code Regulations have an inspection interval requirement.\r\n\r\nPlease furnish copies of DPH required inspections for the following Establishments for calendar years 2024, 2025, and 2026 until the receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nFSE-22-151\t5/14/2025 18:34\tActive\tSushi Do Danbury Hospital\t                        Class IV\r\nFSE-22-5\t6/11/2025 14:37\tActive\tCedar Gables Preschool & Childcare\tClass IV\r\nFSE-23-33\t6/19/2025 22:51\tActive\tBambu\t                                                                Class IV\r\n\r\nPlease provide explanation if no inspections have been conducted.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn.

A copy of that report is available here: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-07/OIG-22-47-July22.pdf. \r\n\r\nLikely Custodians: \r\nThe following DHS-OIG Custodians are believed to have responsive documents and should be tasked: \r\nJames Cuffari, Ph.D., John D. Shiffer, Chief Inspector; Stephanie Christian, Supervisory Lead Inspector Ian Stumpf, Senior Inspector; Erika Algeo, Inspector; Brett Cheney, Inspector; Lisa Knight, Communications Analyst; Lorraine Eide, Independent Referencer.\r\n\r\nProposed Temporal Period: \r\nThe following time period should be searched: \r\nOctober 1, 2021 - Present (i.e., the date on which DHS-OIG FOIA tasks an adequate search for responsive records). \r\nWe are willing to negotiate a narrower temporal period upon a representation from DHS-OIG that responsive records are unlikely to exist in all or part of the temporal scope we have requested. \r\n\r\nLikely Systems of Records: \r\nDHS-OIG should query any email systems the Likely Custodians use, as well as the government-issued phones these custodians use. \r\nDHS-OIG should query any SharePoint or similar drive containing records regarding the Folkston Inspection conducted in November 2021. \r\nDHS-OIG should query the JICMS for any responsive records as described above. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request (pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)\r\nOn behalf of the Al Otro Lado #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, we respectfully request expedited processing. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(i) - Harm to individuals from delayed production. DHS-OIG concluded in its publicly available report.  \r\n\r\n\u201cFolkston did not meet standards for facility conditions, medical care, grievances, segregation, staff-detainee communications, and handling of detainee property. We identified violations that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees. Folkston facilities were unsanitary and dilapidated, with torn mattresses, water leaks and standing water, mold growth and water damage, rundown showers, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, lack of access to hot showers, inoperable toilets, an inoperable thermometer display on a kitchen freezer, and an absence of hot meals. Facility medical staff did not provide timely access to specialty care or adequate mental health care for detainees. Folkston did not provide timely or complete responses to detainee grievances and requests. Folkston also did not consistently provide required services to detainees in segregation and inappropriately handcuffed detainees. Further, ICE did not consistently respond to detainee requests in a timely manner and did not provide detainees with paper grievance forms and submission boxes as required. ICE also did not provide detainees sufficient contact with deportation officers. Lastly, the facility has improperly handled detainee property. In addition, Folkston has not met staffing levels required by the contract with ICE to ensure proper detainee oversight. In addressing COVID-19, Folkston did not consistently enforce use of masks and social distancing. In April 2021, Folkston began providing COVID-19 vaccinations to detainees.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2022, ICE responded to OIG\u2019s 13 recommendations, purportedly providing \u201ccorroboration\u201d that Folkston had been brought into compliance. ICE followed up on June 13, 2022, seeking OIG close its recommendations. OIG treated 12 of 13 recommendations as satisfied and closed them. However, it is unclear how or why OIG concluded it could rely upon the representations of ICE regarding how it had addressed each recommendation, such that the people locked inside Folkston experience a material change in their daily conditions. In several instances, ICE disputed OIG\u2019s findings, even while indicating it would \u201cconcur\u201d with the recommendations that it make changes to implement standards compliance. (See pages 39-42 of Report No. 22-47.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iii) \u2014 Loss of Substantial Due Process Rights to people inside Folkston from delayed production.\r\n\r\nEven after ICE represented to DHS-OIG that it had corrected many the violations it admits OIG documented during the unannounced inspection, detained people inside Folkston reported to DHS many of the very same violations OIG described. According to multiple detained individuals, these conditions unabated.\r\nSee, e.g., https://www.albanyherald.com/news/protests-at-ice-detention-center-mount-as-expansion-plans-move-forward/article_6c8cf39c-c25c-11ec-be63-8bbf37990359.html. \r\n\r\nAn active hunger strike remains ongoing at Folkston to protest these conditions. \r\n\r\nIn the past, ICE officials have attempted to deny the very conditions OIG found in its unannounced inspections during the agency\u2019s communications with House Appropriations Homeland Chair Lucille Roybal-Allard, according to FOIA records obtained from ICE: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6705734-ICE-Emails-Pertaining-to-Congressional-Inquiries.html. \r\n\r\nExpedited processing is warranted under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv) \u2014 A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\r\n\r\nThe future of ICE detention in Georgia and ICE\u2019s use of private immigration detention contractors like The GEO Group is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest on  which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence, and these records requests are directly responsive to this media interest. Accordingly, Expedited Processing is warranted under Section 5.5(e)(1)(iv). \r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden told organizers at a Georgia car rally who interrupted his event to demand he keep his promise to close private prisons and immigration detention centers, \u201cGive me Five Days, Man.\u201d https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-give-me-five-days-hecklers-calling-closure-detention-centers-1587639. As the video makes clear, the President of the United States was referring to privately operated immigration detention centers, as well as private prisons. See also: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-georgia-rally-speech-protest-b1839959.html; https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/04/30/biden_to_protesters_give_me_another_five_days_to_fix_immigration.html; https://nypost.com/2021/04/29/biden-heckled-by-abolish-ice-protesters-teases-action-in-5-days/. \r\n\r\nInstead of ending private prisons in Georgia May 2021, President Biden ordered the termination of ICE\u2019s contract with the Irwin County Detention Center. By December 2021, however, it became clear that far from fulfilling his stated promise, the Biden Administration would actually expand its use of private immigration detention in Georgia: https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/news/closefolkston. https://creativeloafing.com/content-500557-news-brief-private-prison-undergoing-expansion-while-under. \r\n\r\nThen, in February 2022, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported exclusively that the Biden Administration planned an unprecedented expansion of Folkston that would make it the largest ICE facility east of the Mississippi. https://www.ajc.com/news/exclusive-south-georgia-immigration-detention-complex-aims-to-expand/QN5G2BFOPREQHEBDOPPAX2PSVI/. \r\n\r\nIn apparent violation of the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations and Federal Acquisition regulations, this historic expansion would occur through a no-bid, single-vendor contract expansion. The beneficiary: The GEO Group. People supporting those locked inside Folkston protested: https://www.splcenter.org/presscenter/splc-planned-expansion-private-ice-detention-center-georgia-betrayal-biden. \r\n\r\nA people\u2019s movement seeking depopulation of the Folkston facility by ICE and cancellation of the Folkston Contract has been active since 2022. http://www.charltoncountyherald.com/news/second-rally-held-at-the-folkston-ice-processing-center/article_7254cb22-bfe3-11ec-8548-978ce9320949.html.  \r\n\r\nThe timing of DHS-OIG and ICE\u2019s responses to the findings of the November 2021 unannounced inspection raise significant questions about the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s planned expansion of Folkston. At the exact time OIG was informing ICE Folkston was serially non-compliant (OIG No. 22-47 contains perhaps more documented violations of ICE standards than any other DHS-OIG inspection of an ICE facility in history), ICE was planning to reward the contract with an additional expansion. At the exact same time OIG was informing ICE that its contractors had failed to follow through on the financial penalties against GEO that would have followed from the 2019 and 2020 contract discrepancy reports ICE issued, ICE was planning to further reward the non compliant contractor with a no-bid, multi year, multimillion dollar expansion. \r\n\r\nWhy did OIG wait and negotiate with ICE, given the violations it documented, rather than issuing a Management Alert, as it did in Torrance, NM? \r\n\r\nWhat \u201ccorroboration\u201d did ICE provide OIG? \r\n\r\nWhy, given the serial failures of ICE to accurately document the violations OIG found on unannounced inspection, did OIG take ICE at its word and not conduct a second unannounced inspection before closing out its recommendations? \r\n\r\nWhy do people inside Folkston still report the same violations OIG documented if OIG has concluded ICE remedied the violations? \r\n\r\nThe records requested carry the potential to answer these questions and more. The answers are required now \u2014 BEFORE ICE signs a multimillion dollar expansion of a facility that less than 8 months ago failed an unannounced inspection. Failure to grant expedited processing will deprive the public, people inside and those working with Congress and the agency of the public records necessary to corroborate or disprove the current allegations that Folkston is not fit for human occupancy, and is incapable of reform. \r\n\r\nFinally, it appears that despite knowing of OIG\u2019s findings, executives from The GEO Group made affirmative statements during shareholder calls and in public SEC filings that are contradicted by ICE\u2019s concurrence with those findings. Because GEO\u2019s market capitalization of $1.9bn is based nearly exclusively on its ability to obtain and maintain contracts with government partners \u2014 including the ~25-35% of its revenue ICE payments represent \u2014 the investing public has an urgent need to know whether GEO\u2019s executives misled shareholders and the SEC regarding the services the company renders at Folkston, and its relationship with ICE as a contracting partner. \r\n\r\nI certify that the above statements are true and correct pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nRequestor: \r\nAl Otro Lado and its #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Under NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-8, the City has determined that it does not have possession of and/or responsibility for the 911 call audio and transcripts, CAD logs, radio traffic, or any other dispatch records that you have requested.\u00a0 However, the City knows the proper custodian of these records to be Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority (MVRDA), 911 Lake Tahoe Ct., Las Cruces, NM, 88007, (575) 526-0795, https://www.mvrda.org/records-request-instructions/.\u00a0 As such, on December 1, 2025, the City forwarded your request to MVRDA.\u00a0 To expedite your request, you may consider submitting an additional records request to that agency's records custodian directly.\u00a0 In light of this notification, the City considers the request for dispatch records closed.  New Mexico Statutes Annotated (hereinafter \u201cNMSA\u201d) 1978, \u00a7 14-2-8(C) states, in pertinent part, that a \u201cwritten request . . .shall identify the records sought with reasonable particularity.\u201d The purpose of this requirement is to provide governmental agencies with the information necessary to accurately and fully respond to public record requests. Upon review, the City has determined that your request, as currently written, is too broad to process effectively. In order to facilitate a thorough and accurate response, the City will separate each case referenced in your request into individual requests. This approach allows us to address each case independently and ensures a more efficient and complete response. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this request is now closed. Please refer to the respective requests for each case moving forward. Sincerely, \r\nChristine Rivera \r\nRecords Custodian \r\n(575) 541-2112",

We have received your public records act request.  Of note, the attachment states a date of October 30, but it was sent to us via Muckrock on November 19.\r\n\r\nThe request as stated is overbroad and unduly burdensome.  A search of all District Attorney email communications for the words \"prostitution,\" \"sex trafficking\" and \"human trafficking\" for an 11 year period would result in an unreasonably large volume of communication on every case touching upon these issues, as well as every training or discussion on these topics across a large office.  Much of that material would be exempt from disclosure under the CPRA, but working through each document to determine which were not exempt would take years, and is impracticable.\r\n\r\nI would like to help identify the specific documents that are of use to you, so that we can make a targeted search.  Let me know if it would help to discuss over the phone.\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC5AC5.61298380]\r\nHilary Kerrigan | Deputy County Counsel\r\nOffice of the County Counsel, County of Santa Clara\r\n70 West Hedding, East Wing, 9th Floor | San Jos\u00e9, CA 95110\r\nOffice: (408) 299-5925  Mobile: (626) 319-0136\r\nHilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org<mailto:Hilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org> | counsel.sccgov.org<https://counsel.sccgov.org/>\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: The information in this email is confidential and may be protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Doogan,\r\n\r\nThank you for speaking to me on the phone just now.  I understand that your main interest is in learning about the specific cases prosecuted in our County related to the topics you identified.  As I mentioned over the phone, we do not release protected personal identifying information under the California Constitution, nor do we release protected criminal history information or identities of victims under the Penal Code.  If you are interested in deidentified or aggregate data, please let me know the details and I can determine whether such data exists, or alternatively whether it can be extracted via computer programming for a fee.  You can also review the District Attorney's data dashboard here:  Santa Clara County DA Dashboard<https://data.dacalifornia.org/santa-clara>\r\nThe DA's website has reports, data, and policies on various topics here:  Publications and policies | Office of the District Attorney | County of Santa Clara<https://da.santaclaracounty.gov/publications/publications-and-policies>\r\n\r\nAs I explained to you, we do not have a method to run a key word search for documents across the District Attorney's Office generally and I will need you to describe what you are looking for before I am able to search for and identify potentially responsive public records.  You were unable to articulate a focused request over the phone, though I spent many minutes describing to you the various categories of available records, and attempting to redirect you from your insistence on a broad keyword search.  To the degree a keyword search is your primary objective, you can search the County ordinance code here: Code of Ordinances | Santa Clara County, CA | Municode Library<https://library.municode.com/ca/santa_clara_county/codes/code_of_ordinances>, you can review the Board of Supervisors policy manual here:  Board of Supervisors Policy Manual | Office of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors | County of Santa Clara<https://cob.santaclaracounty.gov/governing-documents/board-supervisors-policy-manual>, and you can search meetings, agendas, and related materials for the Board of Supervisors here:  Board of Supervisors Policy Manual | Office of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors | County of Santa Clara<https://cob.santaclaracounty.gov/governing-documents/board-supervisors-policy-manual>  The search term \"human trafficking\" on the last of these resources garnered 3,501 results when I searched just now, so there should be ample material for your preliminary review there.\r\n\r\nPlease reach out if you formulate a more focused request upon review the above.  In the meantime, we consider this request to be closed.\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC5AFB.3E5B6360]\r\nHilary Kerrigan | Deputy County Counsel\r\nOffice of the County Counsel, County of Santa Clara\r\n70 West Hedding, East Wing, 9th Floor | San Jos\u00e9, CA 95110\r\nOffice: (408) 299-5925  Mobile: (626) 319-0136\r\nHilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org<mailto:Hilary.Kerrigan@cco.sccgov.org> | counsel.sccgov.org<https://counsel.sccgov.org/>\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO RECIPIENT: The information in this email is confidential and may be protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in.  Your request was received in this office on 8/25/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-56528.

You have requested records pertaining to: 1. Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 5 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 5 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Fleck,\r\n\r\nThank you for your follow-up regarding your public records request submitted on October 13, 2025. I\u2019d like to clarify that in my previous correspondence, I indicated we would provide an update by November 14, not a completed response. Given the size and complexity of your request, as well as the Division\u2019s current workload, we will require additional time to complete our review and compilation of responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we are providing a list that we believe is responsive to Parts 1 and 2 of your request. This list includes: (a) water rights or applications for water rights submitted by Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton (the \u201cnamed entities\u201d); and (b) water rights for which we have a record of purchase, sale, or transfer involving one or more of these entities.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this list does not distinguish between Part 1 and Part 2 of your request; the information is combined. If you would prefer that the information be separated by request item, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate.\r\n\r\nWe are not providing copies of applications or permits at this time, as those documents are publicly accessible through the Division\u2019s online permit search tool, available here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/PermitSearch.aspx\r\n\r\nIf you are seeking more than just the application or permit (e.g., the entire permit file), please let us know. If a permit file is already in electronic format, we can provide it pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). If it is not available electronically, you may inspect the file in person at our office. Please note that providing full copies of permit files will require additional time.\r\n\r\nWe also have several clarifying questions regarding the remainder of your request (Parts 3\u20139):\r\n\r\n  *   Part 3: You request \u201ca copy of all wells owned.\u201d The Division does not track well ownership directly, but rather manages water rights, which include points of diversion such as wells. If you are seeking information about points of diversion, those can be viewed in the applications and permits available through the online database linked above.\r\n  *   Part 4: This request includes several components:\r\n     *   (a) The Division does not issue a document formally titled as \u201cwell drilling permit.\u201d Instead, we process Notices of Intent (NOIs) to drill wells and receive well logs after drilling. If you are seeking well logs associated with wells held by the named entities, you may search by owner using our well log database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WellLogQuery.aspx. Please let us know if you have any questions, need assistance, or if this does not satisfy this portion of your request.\r\n     *   (b) Regarding \u201cwell monitoring reports,\u201d we issue monitoring waivers for the drilling of/conversion to monitoring wells and receive some depth-to-water measurements for those wells. We also receive pumpage reports for certain wells. Could you please clarify whether you are requesting submitted pumpage reports, depth-to-water data, or both? If you are seeking water level data, you may find it through our water level database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WaterLevelData.aspx\r\n     *   (c) The phrase \u201cmaterials referenced in applications\u201d is quite broad. Could you please specify what types of materials you are seeking?\r\n  *   Part 7: You request \u201ca copy of all protests\u201d filed against the named entities. The permit search database referenced above also includes a tab labeled \u201cAbrogations/Protests/Rulings\u201d that can be used to view protest information, if an application was protested. This can be used in combination with the list we\u2019ve provided in response to Parts 1 and 2.\r\n  *   Part 9: You request \u201ca copy of all petitions for review of canceled permits.\u201d Could you confirm whether this request is limited to petitions involving Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton?\r\n\r\nOnce we receive clarification on the above items, we will be able to provide an updated timeline for processing the remainder of your request. In the meantime, we will continue working on it to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to fulfill this request. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with clarifications or preferences regarding the format or scope of the records you are seeking.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC5553.1B210E70]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.

This link provides access to all records indicated below.\r\n\r\nWe are providing records responsive to Parts 5, 6, and 8 of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nPART 5 \u2013 Copies of Emails, Phone Calls, Teams, and/or Text Messages\r\n\r\nWe have located and are providing emails responsive to this portion of your request. In addition, we are including two call logs. Please note that these logs have been REDACTED to remove non-responsive portions (e.g., calls unrelated to the named entities).\r\n\r\nPART 6 \u2013 Proof of Beneficial Use Applications (2020\u20132025)\r\n\r\nWe located two certificated water rights responsive to this request. These are Permit 80648, Certificate 19594, and Permit 80649, Certificate 19595.\r\n\r\nThese records do not appear to exist in an electronic format and are not required to be created in such a format pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). However, you may visit our Carson City office, where the front desk will make the records available for your inspection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may search our Permits Database by owner name. Under the Maps and Due Dates tab, you can identify any additional permits that may have been certificated by the named entities. Here is a link to the Permits Database: Permit Search<http://ndwrintranet/permitsearch>.\r\n\r\nPART 8 \u2013 Public Comments or Complaints Regarding Named Entities\r\n\r\nWe conducted an electronic search of our database for instances of the three named entities within 10 words of the terms \u201ccomment\u201d or \u201ccomplaint.\u201d This search returned zero matches.\r\n\r\nIf you believe a specific hearing included a comment or complaint concerning one of the named entities, please let us know. That information may help us focus the request further. However, based on our current search, we have not located any responsive records.\r\n\r\nBecause we did not receive clarification on the remaining portions of your request (Parts 3, 4, 7, and 9), we consider this response COMPLETE and the matter CLOSED.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to submit a new request with additional details.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC8F8F.A4AD5330]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.

When I put in the whole title (\"Does v....-05059) I got something in MIssouri. The only other thing I could fin is a recent court case where plaintiffs asked for a mandamus writ to instruct the executive branch to prioritize categories of inmates at high risk for COVID as well as balancing community safety and other release factors they normally take into account. \r\n\r\nYou've gotten my request right. Partly I'm asking because even though I've talked to several other trans activists, none of them seem to know where trans men are sent. From what I hear, trans women are usually sent to Monroe CC. But I wonder if it's always been that way? Or if there are plans to do something different in the future. That's part of why I asked for such a long timeframe. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAdam",

I found out that there was a court case (Does v. DOC, et al: USDC Cause No. 4:21-cv-05059) with a restraining order prohibiting release of information regarding trans inmates and related issues. So my FOIA request couldn't be fulfilled at that time. Just as a summary, the original request was for:\r\n\r\n1. The total number of transgender individuals who are currently incarcerated in a DOC facility broken down by \"trans men\" and \"trans women\".\r\n2. What facility DOC houses trans individuals at.\r\n3. Number of transgender individuals housed in solitary confinement and/or isolation from 2010-2020. \r\n\r\nFor clarification on number 2, what I'm looking for is any sort of policy or directive, email, or other writing showing a practice of \"trans female inmates go to (X) facility, trans male inmates go to (Y) facility\". An example, from what I've heard, trans women tend to go to Monroe. But no one seems to know where trans men go. And I'm wondering if that's an unwritten practice that developed over time or policy.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd check in and see if the restraining order has been lifted and that information is now available to be released.\r\nThank you\r\nAdam Allen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This individual is seen from the angle of another person's BWC, trying to unlock tiny lock boxes with keys found around the property, additionally tossing about the personal belongings of an entire house, in a reckless, damaging and unprofessional manner, showing little to no regard for preservation and documentation of the items found and seized. He is also seen tampering with a cell phone found on a computer table and reading through personal letters/papers. None of which is permitted via the Search Warrant. \r\n\r\nA ton of time was spent loitering the area, alongside Trevor Herrud from WSP, AND Cole Hecker from Grandview from about 15:00 to 18:40. Lionel left no supplemental narratives of being present at this incident, but was mentioned by one officers narrative report. The aftermath of this Search and Seizure execution is volatile. \r\n\r\n Lionel Carmona has recently been included in an WSCJTC complaint that is undergoing an investigation with Yakima County Internal Affair's dept, alongside 13 other officers. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is additional information I can provide, at your request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request will be processed as a public records request and, as such, this letter responds to your request under RCW 42.56.520 and WAC 230-21. Please refer to the Request ID# identified above when contacting this office about your request.\r\n\r\nYou asked for copies of the following GMB records:\r\nRequesting clarification of jurisdiction and what parameters are within policy for employee Lionel Villa Carmona (Leonel) to be involved with in regards to Yakima County.\r\nResponse\r\nThe records at the below link are being provided in response to your request and have not been redacted or deleted. Records will be available to download for 30 calendar days from date of this letter.\r\n\r\nLink: https://gamblingcommission.box.com/s/fan8lrm3lx4f5m7o42phkaw8lsjzlmkr\r\n\r\nThis is the last installment of records in response to your request. Your request has been fulfilled by the production of records (including any exemptions claimed) and is now closed. This is our final response. The GMB does not intend to further address the request, and the PRA's one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has started to run as of the date of this letter. Please contact me within 30 days by e-mail or at the address below, if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the GMB's response to your request and the matter is now considered closed.\r\n\r\nAnytime a request is \"open\" and on-going, a Requester can ask a program to review and modify/change a redaction.  This is not considered an appeal, it is considered regular communication related to a request.  See WAC 388-01-130.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with this determination or any redactions made during the production of any of the records by GMB Public Records, you may ask for review, by writing to:\r\n\r\n               Adam Amorine, Legal Manager\r\n               Washington State Gambling Commission\r\n               PO BOX 42400\r\n               Olympia, WA  98504-2400\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[The official logo and seal of the Washington State Gambling Commission, in dark blue on a white background.]\r\nAllyson 'Al' Roberts\r\nPublic Records Officer, Legal and Records Unit\r\nProtect the public by ensuring that gambling is legal and honest.\r\nEmail:\r\nWeb:\r\nallyson.roberts@wsgc.wa.gov<mailto:allyson.roberts@wsgc.wa.gov>\r\nWSGC.wa.gov<http://wsgc.wa.gov/>\r\nPO Box 42400\r\nOlympia, WA 98504-2400\r\n[Facebook icon]<https://www.facebook.com/WAGamblingCommission/>   [Twitter / X icon] <http://twitter.com/#!/WAGambling>    [LinkedIn icon] <https://www.linkedin.com/company/washingtonstategamblingcommission/>    [Instagram icon] <https://www.instagram.com/wagambling/>\n",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of May 08, 2025, Reference # W070085-050825. \r\n\r\nDear Daniel Moore, \r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Manning and I am the City of Worcester's (City) new Records Access Officer. Part of my transition into this role has been to review outstanding requests and attempt to bring them to a resolution. It has come to my attention that your May 8, 2025 public records request to the City remains outstanding. This request sought the following: Pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law (M.G.L. c.66, \u00a710), I respectfully request access to all records, documents, and communications related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025.As \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to: \r\n\r\n1. **All interview materials**, including: \r\n- Interview scoresheets, panelist rankings, written or digital evaluations \r\n- Any compiled assessments, rubrics, candidate comparison summaries, or recommendation memos \r\n\r\n2. **All internal communications** related to the hiring process, including: \r\n- Emails, memos, letters, Microsoft Teams or Slack messages, and calendar invites \r\n- Meeting recordings, scheduling threads, and attachments \r\n- Communications sent or received by Michael Hamel, Samantha Sendrowski, **Moby George**, HR personnel, interview panelists, or any Department of Innovation & Technology leadership \r\n- Specifically covering any candidates, test results, decision timelines, or escalation concerns \r\n- From April 1, 2025 to the present date \r\n\r\n3. **Hiring process documentation**, such as: \r\n- Full timeline of job posting, interview scheduling, test administration, debriefs, and offer stages \r\n- Number of applicants, screening procedures, and filtering criteria \r\n- Any instructions or documentation provided to interviewers \r\n\r\n4. **All assessment materials**, including: \r\n- Technical test prompts, evaluation rubrics, scoring forms \r\n- Written/recorded test feedback and related correspondence or commentary \r\n- Internal discussions on the test\u2019s creation, intent, or purpose \r\n\r\n5. **All offer documentation**, including: \r\n- Drafts and final offer letters (candidate names may be redacted) \r\n- Related internal approvals, HR communications, or final decision emails \r\n\r\n6. **Meeting materials**, including: \r\n- Agendas, minutes, summaries, attendance logs, and calendar invites from hiring-related meetings \r\n\r\n7. **Any records referencing candidate follow-up, escalation, reconsideration, or delays**, including: \r\n- Emails or notes discussing communication from candidates \r\n- Internal messages referencing escalation to the CIO or Department leadership \r\n- Records discussing hiring delays, decision deferrals, or process suspension \r\n\r\n8. **Documentation of any changes to the role or reporting structure**, including: \r\n- Revisions to the job description, responsibilities, or departmental ownership of the Microsoft 365 Administrator role \r\n- Especially any such documentation involving Samantha Sendrowski or **Moby George** \r\n\r\nPlease include **all responsive documents from April 1, 2025 through the present**, including any drafts, tracked changes, metadata, or attachments. I request these records be provided **electronically** in original formats (.pdf, .msg, .docx, .eml, etc.), with metadata preserved where applicable. \r\ninitial matter your request for \"all records, documents, and communications related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025.\" fails to reasonably describe the record or category of records that you are seeking. The Suffolk Superior Court found that under the Public Records Law \u201c[t]he reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d See Jaideep Chawla v. Dept of Revenue, Suffolk. Sup. No. l 784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019).\u00a0The court further indicated \u201c[r]equests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently \u2018related\u2019 to the category of materials requested, will not satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d\u00a0 Accordingly, your request for a virtually unlimited scope of documents \"...related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025\" is not sufficiently particular as to satisfy the statutory standard of a request that \u201creasonably described the public record sought.\u201d See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a)(i). \r\nI will now proceed to address the enumerated categories of your request. With regards to the items sought by categories one (all interview materials) and four (all assessment materials) these requests seek records that are exempt under\u00a0Exemption (L) of the Public Records Law. These records constitute questions and answers, scoring keys and sheets and other materials used to develop, administer or score job interviews for the Microsoft 365 Administrator and similar positions within the City's government. The City frequently reuses identical or very similar questions when conducting job interviews. To release these records would risk future candidates gaining an unfair advantage when interviewing with the City.\u00a0 The City will also withhold \"[a]ny instructions or documentation provided to interviewers\" and \"screening procedures, and filtering criteria\" under\u00a0Exemption (L) for the reasons noted above. \r\nWith regards to the portions of your requests that seek communications from the City and between City employees,\u00a0pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(vii), it is valid for the City to suggest a \u201creasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the City to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably.\u201d See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(vii). In order for the City to search for communications responsive to your request, I would suggest that you provide key words for the communications that you are searching for and specific city employees or departments who you believe may have records responsive to your request (I understand that for some of the items sought that you provided names of City employees) but it would be helpful to expand this for all communications sought.\u00a0 In addition to the aforementioned suggestions, it may also be useful to narrow the date range of your request. \r\nWith regards to your request for \"[a]ll offer documentation\" (category 5), the City will withhold all offer letters under\u00a0Exemption (c), offer letters are found within City employees personnel files and are therefore\u00a0exempt from disclosure. See Colman M. Herman v. City of Boston, et. al., Suffolk Superior Court, Civil Action No. 2384CV2395 (June 20, 2024) (\u201cpersonnel files . . . shall be considered exempt under exemption (c)\") \r\nFinally in light of the time elapsed since you placed your public records request, should you wish to withdraw this request, please let me know and the City can consider this request closed. \r\nUnder the Public Records Law, I must inform you that you have the right to appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records pursuant to subsection (a) of section 10A of the Public Records Law and 950 CMR 32.08(1). You also have the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court under subsection (c) of section 10A. \r\nSincerely, \r\nMichael Manning \r\nRecords Access Officer \r\nCity of Worcester Law Department",
