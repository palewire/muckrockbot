Documented seeks the above listed records for noncommercial use as a representative of the news media. Documented qualifies as a news media organization under the definition provided by Congress in the OPEN Government Act because it \u201cgathers information of potential interest to a large segment of the public, and uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.\u201d\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Documented is seeking this FOIA request because the information in it is of interest to a large portion of the public, including the many concerned citizens that regularly acquire information through our extensive range of publications. These publications include websites, blogs, newsletters, reports, press statements, social media networks such as Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Documented reaches out to many traditional news media outlets that regularly broadcast our publications through television, radio, print and electronic articles and interviews.\r\n\r\nDocumented plans to compile the information from this request into a distinct, original work that will be released to the public through the publications listed above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSonny Albarado, a citizen of Arkansas, in coordination with Colette Rosenberg.",

Marmur attempted to hijack an airplane at Sea-Tac Airport on July 14th of 1954. Following this hijacking attempt, Marmur was reportedly wanted for armed robbery in San Francisco in 1956. \r\n\r\nThis attempt hijacking, which resulted in changes to the security procedures at Sea-Tac Airport, is detailed here: https://historylink.org/File/23060\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Edmund Andrew Marmur from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Edmund Andrew Marumr held by the San Francisco and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Edmund Andrew Marmur. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Edmund Andrew Marmur.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Edmund Andrew Marmur. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for correspondence either to or from Director Hoover, or Associate Director Clyde Tolson, regarding Marmur and the July 14th 1954 hijacking attempt. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
